A powerful storm has scattered toys in different areas around the North Pole, and Santa needs your help to find them. Players six years and up will enjoy interacting with both the board and the DVD to bring each Misfit toy back in time for Christmas Eve. You'd better hurry, though--Bumble, the Abominable Snow Monster, wants the toys too. Even those who've never seen the Christmas classic will enjoy clips from the original footage as they race against time to solve puzzles and collect the toys."}
