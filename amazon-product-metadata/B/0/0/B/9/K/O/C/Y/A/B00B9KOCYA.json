This allows you to connect and use USB devices such as digital cameras, external hard drives, flash drives, and printers, all from a single hub.DesignThe Hub is uniquely designed with three switches that control each group of three USB 3.0 ports; each group of three is lit with an attractive blue LED when powered on, as well as a separate LED for each port when a device is in use. With the slim, strip-shape design the Hub saves your precious desktop space, and also adds style with a sleek, glossy finish.PerformanceProviding data rates of up to 5Gbps - 10 times faster than USB 2.0. You can transfer your photos, music, and HD movies to a USB 3.0 external storage device faster than ever before.PowerEquipped with a power 5V supply, the Satechi 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub guarantees electric current stability and the effective operation of connected USB devices. It does not require any software, drivers, or complicated installation process.CompatibilityCompatible with Windows 8/7/Vista/XP/2003/2000/ME, Mac OS X (latest updates from Apple required),  and Linux kernels 3.0 and later. Full forward and backward compatibility between USB 3.0 and 2.0/1.1 hosts and devices.Note:2.4Ghz wireless devices, such as wireless keyboard and mouse adapters, may not work in close proximity to USB 3.0 devices or hubs. Connecting to a USB 2.0 port is recommended.We recommend that no more than three external hard drives be connected to the 10-Port USB 3.0 Hub at one time. The 10-Port Hub contains three chipsets (one chipset can operate one external hard drive efficiently). The three external hard drives should be connected to the first three ports on the hub (closest to the power source)."}
