After the first application, skin is immediately soft, supple, and refreshed; after a couple of weeks, skin is firmer, denser, smoother, and more vibrant. In time, this formula restores collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic-acid synthesis to visibly reduce the appearance of wrinkles and improve skin density."}
