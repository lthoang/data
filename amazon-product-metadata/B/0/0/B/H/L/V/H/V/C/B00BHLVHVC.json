It is sold by Apple as part number 922-5065.  The flat tip is 1/4\" wide and it is reinforced nylon and a handy heat resistant solder tool. There's a notch near the flat end to catch and bend small wires.The fatter tool is a heavy duty version of the first nylon tool.The longest tool has a beveled end for tight spaces and a notched end for small screws.All the nylon tools are designed to not mar delicate surfaces.  They are also an ideal material for use in ESD protected areas and temperature resistant so will not melt when soldering.  They are made in the USA for superior quality.The metal one is what many professionals use to open iPhones, iPads, and cases that require more leverage or a sharper tip.  It's handy for cell phones, laptops, LCD screens, and other plastic electronics especially where the LCD cover is glued to the screen.  I've also been able to open some plastic AC/DC power supplies with it. This is made of metal so it is stronger than the plastic tools, but you have to be more aware of possible scratching.  Approx 4 3/4\" long.", "title": "Set of 4 Professional Laptop, LCD, iPad, iPod Spudgers Non-Mar Nylon and Metal Pry Open Repair Tools for Plastic Cell Phone, Tablet and MP3 Cases", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31gY9CdH-HL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00792JJK4", "B001LKZNMI", "B008KOTNVA", "B00BG8WW2Y", "B00876JHBM", "B00AF2K7L0", "B00FS5X0WW", "B0026IFMGQ", "B009MKGRQA", "0789750732", "B00E3CHLLC", "B003UCODIA", "B00C7YL7KO", "B00HKL3DEM", "B00C78SXRK", "B00GFJS5FC", "B009KZ20D6", "B008CLO7Q2", "B00BXYWXY8", "B004N96WQ0", "B008HYVG6I", "B00CFQWBCM", "B003FVVD70", "B005EVV8LK", "B008TM1910", "B00CIBRS9A", "B00CZE998I", "B00GY5WO8G", "B001KBEO1O", "B000NZ5QGK", "B002RCXZZ6", "B009SBE0YE", "B000BQJ612", "B000MF754W", "B00FJFW7VG", "B004WIQW3U", "B00004TUCV", "B000FGQ1G6", "B00EI20BYQ", "B003N3G4WY", "B004UU9G6A", "B00D9O3QBO", "B0001NYK16", "B0055U6X4M", "B005N8X2GI", "B004N8ZQKY", "B006YG8X9Y", "B003XS9DY0", "B00JTXUOJ6", "B00EC443V2", "B00524NXJ4", "B006RBANAS", "B00009XT3H", "B002RL7YJ0", "B007XGWQ2Y", "B000RB38X8", "B003E48ERU", "B007USRGI4", "B0029T6X2O", "B0006OBFOA", "B0096AT61O", "B00HL27C2E", "B0042TLA90", "B001DD1UJS", "B00DQ0HJCI", "B00CXWAP0S", "B00004Z5D1", "B00FHRYE0S", "B007XWVVN8", "B00F0P13ZQ", "B00GY4LL3G", "B00B0FYHUI", "B008OC0E5M", "B00880EDIO", "B002J9SMP0", "B00BQ8RM1A", "B00DSGLM64", "B005GISZ1M", "B00EOM5NLQ", "B00A8Q9U34", "B009LIJG8O", "B008TM18X4", "B000F9CS1U", "B003TOFFNQ", "B00BXYWXV6", "B00GLBFET4", "B00FRMUHMW", "B00CJDENDG", "B00GOIWXMA", "B00JQ10CTS", "B000AM8BBI", "B00FZPDG1K", "B00637X42A", "B00480FQJ8", "B000OGX5AM", "B00FZPGDLA", "B005Z1ZWEI", "B003M6C6UG", "B0019N4VDE", "B00HITR7DE"], "bought_together": ["B00792JJK4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00792JJK4", "B00A8Q9U34", "B00E3CHLLC", "B001LKZNMI"]}}
