It is small enough to make the most of limited countertop space, but still has the capacity to handle full-size plates. It has an integrated drip tray with a swivel spout that pivots in all directions so you can drain water directly into the sink from any position. A fingerprint-proof coating helps protect against smudges. The wine glass holder hangs up to 3 wine glasses upside-down by the stem a\" even a couple of those extra-large Bordeaux glasses."}
