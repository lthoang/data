A Category 6 Ethernet Patch Cable is also referred to as a Cat6 Network Cable, Cat6 Cable, Cat6 Ethernet Cable, or Cat6 Data/LAN Cable.* The cable's RJ45 connectors offer universal connectivity to computers and network components, such as routers, switch boxes, network printers, and network attached storage devices.Built for Future-proof Speed and Reliable Connectivity* This Cat6 cable supports up to 550 MHz and is suitable for 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet), 1000BASE-T / 1000BASE-TX (Gigabit Ethernet) and 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet).* Our cables are made of 100% bare copper wire as opposed to copper clad aluminum (CCA) wire, therefore fully compliant with UL Code 444, which require pure bare copper wire in Cat6 communications cables. Our Cat6 patch and bulk cables are used by major data centers around the world.Specifications* Cable Type: CAT6* Outside Diameter: 5.8  0.3 mm* Jacket Material: PVC* Conductor Material: 100% Bare Copper* Contact Plating: 50 Micron Gold Plated* Conductor Gauge: 24 AWG* Cable Performance: Up to 550 MHz* Cable Structure: Stranded Twisted Pair* Cable Shielding: Unshielded (UTP)* UL and EIA/TIA Verified* Power over Ethernet (POE) and Voice Over IP (VOIP) compliant", "title": "Cable Matters Cat6 Snagless Ethernet Patch Cable in Black 25 Feet", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41odE9ZGkyL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00C2DLRV4", "B007NZHQDY", "B00C2CA3N8", "B00C2DL96W", "B00C2CBBAM", "B00C2DLI9A", "B00DUYDFVY", "B00G9BN9KW", "B00G9BNAKG", "B00DUYD5NC", "B00B3UR496", "B007NZWF58", "B00B3VK9VU", "B00B3URY64", "B007NZKWLC", "B00G9BN8MG", "B00DUYE50O", "B00G9BN7TK", "B00G9BN6AA", "B00C4U030G", "B00E5I7YYS", "B0000BVYT3", "B007O09EPG", "B00E5I7VJG", "B00HSSRZNC", "B000N99BBC", "B00G9BN6ZK", "B00DUYDHQC", "B00BJP0LUE", "B00C2BCVAM", "B00HSSRYGA", "B001E1Y5O6", "B00006RVPW", "B001IGU2EE", "B004C3ZPEW", "B008VOUDK4", "B00B3UTRWI", "B00B3X4NM4", "B001QUA6R0", "B001QUA6RA", "B00A121WN6", "B00HQ0AP9I", "B001P8B6P4", "B00HEM5ONU", "B004TLIVBQ", "B00HSSRUQO", "B00B3VL3SS", "B00G9BN4L6", "B00C2BQDUG", "B0031TRZX2", "B004BUVAS6", "B00CLRFCB2", "B00G9BNERU", "B00G9BN2UE", "B00HEM5V2O", "B00E5I7WBS", "B00G9BNFT2", "B003UR8XRC", "B00DUYCHAE", "B000JV3CKA", "B000JJLHIQ", "B000IZECH4", "B00HGLVZLY", "B00HEM6KCE", "B003XM73P2", "B003VANO7C", "B002JP92K8", "B000J2EN4S", "B00ESG5UWK", "B00CXU1NHY", "B004UMUNVU", "B000FNFSPY", "B00C2DZ9EU", "B00C2BG7ZC", "B0083X8VZW", "B004C9O6T6", "B0057XC2MO", "B001EVGIYG", "B00G9BNKAG", "B00023413M", "B00B3X2D3K", "B006QB1RPY", "B00C2DZ8RI", "B00E3W1726", "B00B3UT5JI", "B001CY0P7G", "B00DUYD9RE", "B0044GJ516", "B00DUYD7YO", "B007NZWTJA", "B000BSLWAS", "B0002JFN4M", "B007O04XDO", "B00C7RZPJ0", "B00D80J2XU", "B003C2QS90", "B00HEM656U"], "bought_together": ["B007NZHQDY", "B00C2DL96W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007O09EPG", "B007NZHQDY", "B00G9BN9KW", "B00G9BNAKG"]}}
