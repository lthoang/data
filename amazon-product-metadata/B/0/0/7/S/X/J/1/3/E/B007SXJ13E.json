ND Filter Set (ND2 / ND4 / ND8)- Works with any lens with a 67mm filter thread; manual or autofocus, digital or film.- ND filters (Neutral Density) reduce the amount of light reaching the film without affecting the color. Can be used to enable slower shutter speeds. Also can be used to better separate subjects from the background by allowing wider apertures, effectively decreasing depth of field. Great for portraiture and outdoor scenes.- These filters are double threaded allowing additional filters or accessories to be mounted one over the other.- Made of high quality plastic and aluminum metal. Multicoated lens for reduced lens flare and ghosting caused by reflections.- Filters serve as a great and inexpensive lens protector. Use one at all times to protect your delicate lens from dirt, scratches and accidental damage. Better to scratch or break a filter than an expensive lens.- PremiumMagicFiber Microfiber Cleaning Cloth- Ultra gentle! Extremely fine microfiber leaves zero scratches, streaks or marks. Safe for all lenses.- Features special saw tooth pattern edges. Other sellers' cloths have unfinished edges that will fray easily, the weave becoming undone and threads pulling out easily. Our microfibers are made with premium materials and designed to the highest standard of quality.- Ideal for cleaning oil and dirt off eyeglasses, iPhone/iPad and other touch screens, binocular lenses, digital SLR and other camera lenses, GPS devices, and other delicate optics.- Clean without the need of soaps or detergents. Wipe down kids' toys, cribs, stainless steel counters and other areas you want to keep chemical free.- Great value for your money. Reusable and long lasting. No more paper towel and tissue waste.- Size: 6 x 7 inches (15cm x 18cm)- Each microfiber is individually and neatly packed in it's own polyurethane plastic bag for long term safekeeping."}
