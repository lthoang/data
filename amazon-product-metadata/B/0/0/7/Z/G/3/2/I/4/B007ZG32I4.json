The familiar HiFiMan sonic signature provides a very detailed yet warm listening experience. Best of all, the HE-400 is priced far lower than many comparable cans, bringing true audiophile quality to the masses. \"The best-sounding full-size, home headphones I've ever tested.\" - Steve Guttenberg, CNet.com \"The open air design leads to a lovely soundstage- where you can hear and sense the space around instruments. The bass is solid, but not overwhelming, with excellent tightness...In the realm of planar headphones, the HE-400's represent a tremendous bargain. Not only have they lowered the cost of acquiring a pair of planar headphones, they have designed them in such a way that you don't need to spend even more money on an amplifier capable of driving them. Their ability to deliver beautiful music from smaller power sources is downright impressive. Highly recommended!\" - Stephen Hornbrook, Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity \"Because of the open-back design, the soundstage was wonderful. Plus, there was no hint of muddiness. I haven't heard Led Zeppelin sound so clear before....The HE-400 handled every genre of music, from classical to rock, like a champ. Everything I listened to sounded more fun, more detailed, more alive.\" - Bill Henderson, Gadgeteer", "title": "HiFiMan - HE-400 Headphones", "price": 299.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dYtxr058L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "HiFiMAN", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CICPMA6", "B00CICPN0K", "B00CICPTHC", "B00HAOSDOO", "B0070UFMOW", "B00AE0IEHM", "B00862522A", "B00B6QXWIY", "B00K6NJSZ4", "B00IOWPOLG", "B008J26ZL4", "B004357WL8", "B005N6ZAT2", "B007ZSYHYU", "B00CICPQTI", "B00EPFLJS8", "B006695A8G", "B003L1717K", "B00A9LHLQ6", "B00L1LXOWS", "B004QVNS0S", "B004T335BK", "B00KFAG64O", "B004LPZBD6", "B0053KWDES", "B00018MSNI", "B00I4Q9S32", "B000BQU1F2", "B003UCESP8", "B00AWLEAH6", "B0011UB9CQ", "B002Z9JWZS", "B00D73JV6G", "B00K6Q2A4C", "B00JRGLX3G", "B009326J6U", "B00A2QJMRY", "B00B3QD94O", "B00H00VLZQ", "B008JGWY2Y", "B00667F7OK", "B00ENO322C", "B009S331VU", "B001DK1ZVO", "B0002MT6RY", "B005DK08X6", "B001MXLD4G", "B00A2QKSVI", "B00GO4GMAI", "B0006DPNNK", "B00004SY4H", "B00C85NF52", "B0088IC1SA", "B00882U782", "B005T421IG", "B00GCDJBMM", "B00415AHFS", "B00I9E54IM", "B00A2QM5O6", "B005CNR7B0", "B0031RD3YY", "B0024NK344", "B00BW4RWH2", "B00B4YE5BG", "B009EEGVY2", "B0042A8CW2", "B00E9O6C96", "B00AYASHL0", "B00CGA28MU", "B004YEBK66", "B004QMH8KI", "B00GYCZEKO", "B005STCILC", "B007TIV7IU", "B00D1DDKNM", "B00BW4XQZ4", "B001OV789U", "B004QVPGXK", "B00029MTMQ", "B000I1IG8Y", "B00GCDVNHI", "B005VO7LG6", "B00009MK3A", "B00BF6IKL4", "B007Q2O6KK", "B004FI6AKW", "B00002MXUH", "B005EV38AE", "B000PCF8WS", "B003N0XDT4", "B00E8PAAUS", "B00FI5V7RC", "B00EE9B3LI", "B00DUKP37C", "B00F2II49Y", "B00E0DMCO0", "B000X0KHZK"], "bought_together": ["B00CICPMA6", "B00CICPN0K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CICPMA6", "B00CICPN0K", "B00B3QD94O", "B00CICPTHC"]}}
