The Lumix SZ1 (16.1 megapixels) features 720p HD video recording capabilities, and both models are easy to use thanks to Panasonic's popular iA (Intelligent Auto) mode which automatically chooses the best camera settings for natural, beautiful images.Panasonic Lumix SZ1 Highlights10x Optical Zoom in a Slim BodyThe DMC-SZ1 features a powerful 10x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 25-250mm). This gives you highly natural expressions from people and animals that you can't get close to. And its slim, compact body can easily go wherever you go &ndash; for both everyday snapshots and traveling. In addition, this single camera lets you record 10x optical zoom in video recording.20x iA Zoom (Intelligent Zoom)The iA Zoom (Intelligent Zoom) is an extensive zoom function using digital zoom, however, you can even draw the subject 2x closer than the original optical zoom with minimum deterioration of image quality thanks to the Intelligent Resolution technology. This means the 10x optical can virtually extend to 20x equivalent.25mm Ultra Wide-angle LensThe 25mm ultra wide-angle lens* has about twice the shooting area as a standard 35mm lens. This enhances all kinds of shooting situations, like when you're photographing a group of people at an indoor party or shooting a large structure or sweeping landscape while traveling.*Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the wide-end.New LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR Lens SystemThe new high-quality LEICA DC lens system is even more versatile with 25mm ultra wide-angle to powerful 10x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 25-250mm). Comprising 9 elements in 7 groups including 4 aspherical lenses with 6 aspherical surfaces, adoption of ultra thin lens for its new structure optical system makes the unit's overall length short to fit in the slim body despite its versatile zoom range from ultra wide to telephoto.Passing Leica's stringent standards, the DMC-SZ1 boasts exceptional optical performance with stunning clarity with minimum distortion and flare.MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)The MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) compensates for the blurring caused by hand-shake. Even slight hand-shake movement is accurately detected by a sampling frequency of 4,000 times per second, and compensated to produce sharp, clear images.Shooting ModesThe Lumix SZ1 feature two new shooting modes &ndash; Miniature Effect and Panorama Shot. In Miniature Effect mode, the peripherals are defocused while saturation and contrast is emphasized to make the picture like a diorama. Video recorded in Miniature Effect mode is played back in 10x fast-forwarding, making it comical and fun to watch*1. Panorama Shot makes it possible to shoot a horizontal or vertical panoramic image by taking consecutive shots and then overlaying the photos for the effect of a panoramic photo. Furthermore, the Lumix SZ1 features Creative Retouch which includes six filters -Toy Effect, Soft Focus Dynamic Monochrome, Expressive, High Key and Retro, each of which give the photo a more artistic look. It also features an Auto Retouch function that adjusts contrast and brightness to give the photo a different look &ndash; all with a single press of the button.*1 Sound will not be recorded with [MINIATURE EFFECT] in Creative Control Mode and approximately 1/10 of the time period is recorded. (If you record for 10 minutes, the resulting motion picture recording will be approximately 1 minute long)iA (Intelligent Auto) ModeTo help ensure that the Lumix SZ1 is easy to use, it features Panasonic's popular iA (Intelligent Auto) mode. In iA mode, a suite of technologies are automatically engaged and the camera chooses the best setting based on the shooting environment. For instance, iA includes AF Tracking, Intelligent ISO Control, MEGA O.I.S., Face Detection, Intelligent Scene Selector and Intelligent Exposure.Additional Features3.0-inch Intelligent LCD that automatically adjusts the backlight based on the environment's lightingThe Lumix SZ1 features a CCD sensorUSB power charging in addition to the conventional AC power supplyDedicated video record button which lets users instantly start recording a video without having to make any extra settings.
