{"asin": "B002IKLJUU", "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo"]], "description": "The DMC-GF1 has large, high-resolution LCD but Panasonic made Live View Finder (DMW-LVF1) for finder-enthusiasts.The DMW-LVF1 displays the same information as the LCD when you equip the DMC-GF1 with it. It is effectively used in situations where the LCD is difficult to see, such as under bright sunlight. And it is also handy for low-angle shots because it can be tilted vertically from 0 to 90 degrees.Note: the DMW-LVF1 must be attached to the hot shoe of the DMC-GF1, so it cannot be used in combination with an external flash.Technical SpecificationsType: Live View Finder (field sequential, 202,000-dot equivalent)Field of view: Approx. 100%Magnification: Approx. 1.04x / 0.52x (35mm camera equivalent) with 50mm lens at infinity; -1.0m-1Eye point: Approx. 17.5mm from eyepiece lensDiopter adjustment: -4.0 - +4.0 m-1Dimensions: Approx.
