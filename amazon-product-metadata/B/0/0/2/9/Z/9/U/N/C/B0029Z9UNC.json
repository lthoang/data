For such a small and compact sized speaker, the sound that it produces is quite the complete opposite. With exceptional tonal fidelity, the AR302 surprises with its ability to handle your music and media with high quality reproduction. A well-balanced sound with minimal distortion is made possible by a frequency response of 40Hz to 20kHz; ensuring clear and cohesive audio all throughout. It responds nicely with midranges and dares to extend into higher-frequency audio ranges &#x2013; making the AR302 a speaker system that strives to deliver its absolute best, and then some. The satellites feature solid wooden enclosures with an accent of smooth polished black, adding a clean, modern taste to any audio device it syncs with.", "title": "Arion Legacy AR302-BK 2.0 Desktop PC Speakers - Black, 12 Watts", "price": 15.98, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zQoPjRC1L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Arion Legacy", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B009P8KTPE", "B006YTZUA6", "B00K5NYNWS", "B00006L3C6", "B009P8O3II", "B009IBXSV0", "B00ENMYSAE", "B009GWSJE2", "B0056BPUQC", "B0041QBAIA", "B00B3ZNMYC", "B00B40CYL8", "B001LDMH4C", "B00005BC0K", "B00006B9W1", "B00006B9W3", "B0027VT6V4", "B008F2YEN4", "B001LDRO2W", "B0015C30J0", "B00FW3KZNM", "B0045R21HO", "B00CRR5YN2", "B00ESKS9L0", "B00AFQZ4AU", "B00005BC0J", "B009IBXUNG", "B0095XWY1G", "B0006G2M8Q", "B00711MUTA", "B00008MN45", "B007PXV2K2", "B00CXLK1X0", "B00IJ356CM", "B00CDJJZV6", "B002HWRZ2K", "B003CP0OT2", "B00CDJJZXO", "B00EZ9XKCM", "B0041Q9PZ0", "B00JOCCI8W", "B00006B9W2", "B00466YWPS", "B000068P8R", "B00GHY5JAO", "B000P1D7O0", "B00181T20O", "B00113PUJQ", "B0070YJQEA", "B0097OUESI", "B00BJE3WEW", "B007GF9N96", "B0015BYQJE"], "bought_together": ["B0033Z2BAQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0027VT6V4", "B003CP0OT2", "B009P8KTPE", "B008I646WG"]}}
