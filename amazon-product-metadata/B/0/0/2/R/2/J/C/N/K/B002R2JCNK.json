{"asin": "B002R2JCNK", "description": "Legendary performance. 100% Tournament legal.\n\nCreated with precision and accuracy in mind, the FPS Freek is our flagship accessory. Fueled by our desire to win, the FPS Freek was developed for the sole purpose of becoming better at first-person shooters. The result has become somewhat of a legend. Proven a winner time and time again, the FPS Freek has been praised by numerous professionals, enthusiasts and n00bs alike.\n\nBy increasing the length of the thumb-sticks slightly, precision while aiming is improved dramatically. Your range of motion is increased by 40%, giving you the opportunity to make smaller adjustments and \"snap\" to targets much faster in first-person shooters. This affords you the luxury of turning up controller sensitivities to get the closest feel to a mouse possible on a console. The greater leverage offers you better control and less force-alleviating thumb-fatigue and adding more comfort to long gaming sessions. In short, this increased accuracy and decreased thumb-fatigue results in more kills and less deaths.\n\nIn the competitive world of online gaming, you'd be crazy to play without the FPS Freek!\n\nFPS Freek is designed to fit both the PS3 and Xbox 360 controllers but will also fit many third-party versions.\n\nWorks great in games like:\n\n * Modern Warfare 2\n * Battlefield: Bad Company 2\n * Call of Duty: Black Ops\n * Halo: Reach\n * Medal of Honor", "price": 15.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z8pHhcnDL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005Z3DYPK", "B008Y1WGK4", "B005D7G3LA", "B001AW156U", "B00FWWY1V0", "B00BTOAFXS", "B005Z2DRXU", "B003YI458I", "B004VLYIE8", "B00FK2X2T4", "B00HUWANOO", "B00HSR3CQW", "B00840353W", "B00ABKFN6K", "B00ABK9E5Q", "B00EINBZZ4", "B002R3NQHC", "B007HSKSMI", "B00AKXTBMK", "B000RAXU4Q", "B00EZV6HHU", "B009GXLZVU", "B000N91ZP2", "B003NSLGW2", "B00B1MXGDO", "B005S31ZBC", "B003O6CBIG", "B008M4BNQG", "B003V4AK8E", "B00E5UHSX8", "B008DBO4UK", "B007PNBTZK", "B00DDVLWEG", "B006C27JXG", "B005Z2MVQ4", "B003G9MR3U", "B0011E63A0", "B004YUB6ZU", "B001AWIP68", "B00FBV6V56", "B0053OLY9O", "B007XVTR3K", "B0038XNTWW", "B003F1M3Q0", "B009OJNQQ8", "B002DGPNOM", "B004ASOLLM", "B002GJRQRS", "B00B08REVY", "B008B8J1WQ", "B003ZSN600", "B00DC9SWWE", "B002P35JMO", "B00HUW2SUQ", "B00GYO9D0O", "B002I098JE", "B003VWXV50", "B0015AARJI", "B00EEMLPR2", "B00HVBPRUO", "B007RTO27E", "B00CHYOP8A", "B007XVTR5S", "B00HUUIJAQ", "B0099OZR9W", "B00EFRNG0A", "B00C9UND8K", "B000B6MLPU", "B003WY86L6", "B00BMFIXT2", "B001E93IWI", "B00CXTX2YW", "B006DIA77E", "B00I6BOSYY", "B0087OZ5FG", "B00DUARBNG", "B000OYMYZQ", "B00D2EGWDA", "B0088MVOU2", "B002GJRQSC", "B00EV0CZYE", "B005UI9BT8", "B00269QLI8", "B003O6EDSM", "B00519C7CE", "B00503E8S2", "B0050SYILE", "B0050SXKU4"], "bought_together": ["B008Y1WGK4", "B00FWWY1V0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004VLYIE8", "B00HSR3CQW", "B008Y1WGK4", "B003YI458I"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2927}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Xbox"]]}
