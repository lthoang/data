{"asin": "B002DPTQ8W", "description": "Music professionals know well designed earphones shouldn&#x2019;t compete with outside noises. High listening volumes not only distort sound, they&#x2019;re not healthy. A superior seal to block out ambient sound is critical. Once that&#x2019;s achieved, only the highest definition micro-speakers will do. BackBeat Pro earphones deliver both. Super flexible SnugFit&#x2122; neoprene ear tips, plus dual flange technology, conform to your ear for superior noise isolation. The balanced armature speakers &#x2013; essentially full-range miniaturized speakers with built-in amplifiers &#x2013; are professionally tuned for musician-grade sound. The result is true high-definition, ultra-low distortion audio that rivals recording studio reference speakers.
