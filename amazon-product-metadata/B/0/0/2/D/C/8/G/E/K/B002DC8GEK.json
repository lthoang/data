A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options. This includes 16-player online versus action, as well as a 4-player online co-op support and two-player split-screen functionality in local co-op play. In addition, the intense and action packed campaign mode allows for 4-player online co-op play to clear mission objectives with friends, unlockable weapons and the ability to resurrect fallen comrades.Weaponry and GadgetsNo action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and to that endLost Planet 2comes loaded with a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.
