You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.
