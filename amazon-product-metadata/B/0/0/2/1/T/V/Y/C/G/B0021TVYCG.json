Dark magic surges into the land to fill the void. Recognizing the potential for complete control over the dark powers, Gandohar starts to use the power of Aziraal trapped within Kyra, the descendant of the Orphans. Despite her ancestry, Kyra cannot endure the strain. With Antaloor already in his clutches, Gandohar concocts a new plan from his stronghold in Oswaroth, yet there are still those who struggle against the tyrant, hoping to shift the balance of forces in their favor. Five years have passed since dramatic events brought the whole world to the edge of the abyss. \"The Hero\" is a prisoner in the dungeons of Gandohar's castle. His hopes of saving his sister vanished with his freedom. Just as despair threatens to overcome him, hope comes from where he would have least expected. The Orcs, a race the Hero had always hated, have put together a rescue squad that frees him from his bonds. He emerges into a land desecrated by evil. He embarks on a journey to shed light on Gandohar's dark past, hoping to discover a weak point in his enemy's defense. If he fails, he will lose his sister forever.", "price": 10.15, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61A7bacurIL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003O6G1L4", "B0044SA734", "B003FBL85M", "B001BTPRKC", "B002I0J6KU", "B000ZK695U", "B000HCJD68", "B0047TLIBU", "B000K9OR4Q", "B003DLQTYY", "B003DNLDUC", "B003P9FRGA", "B004WL4LOY", "B000G7X5Q8", "B004A87506", "B001CBW18U", "B00B59MXGY", "B009PJH47Y", "B002DC8GKO", "B0056WJA6M", "B005185SDA", "B002I0J4AM", "B003O6HDRU", "B002BRZ744", "B001D7T2VC", "B004NRN5EO", "B0014QAO4Q", "B007FMSH4M", "B003H0CBYS", "B00576U7W8", "B00354NANC", "B009VURUYE", "B00170823O", "B002AB7TX8", "B004ML44Y6", "B0014UGK8G", "B001UWGCW2", "B0057PERNE", "B003O6HAS2", "B003S2MXQG", "B0016GC9D8", "B003O6HE0Q", "B00J22636W", "B00BGA9V2Q", "B00139RPNC", "B0022TNO7I", "B000UW1YBW", "B000WCT1KQ", "B002I0K5NC", "B000TVT7U4", "B0045ZIEPY", "B005C2D1YI", "B003O6EDSM", "B00320J6W8", "B008XMSR6G", "B004EW948E", "B001IK5TJI", "B004FUI84G", "B005GM3XVA", "B0050SX2MK", "B001NX6GBK", "B0023CBZ70", "B000NGP1R8", "B002BXJ9VA", "B00CJ7IUI6", "B000KLNLUK", "B0085CA8QG", "B002W5GIB6", "B0032LTVX6", "B002BRZ6UE", "B00KAEITQ8", "B00319DX4M", "B002I0JBL4", "B003GT8IL0", "B004MXM7WU", "B0050SX9VO", "B002I0J6DC", "B001ASJIS6", "B005VBVQDI", "B004UDB9SA", "B002I0J5JW", "B005TH6BD4", "B0081B1O5A", "B000K9OP2A", "B0050SXX88", "B000FQ2DTA", "B0050SXGU8", "B000GKCI4A", "0744013240", "B00IBC6NE6", "B009GZX49Y", "B00KVU378G", "B000NJH6YG", "B007SRM5U6", "B0058VI2LA", "B00432O50W", "B002EZH804", "B0050SXUT0", "B00182QCZ6"], "bought_together": ["B003O6G1L4", "B0044SA734"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044SA734", "B003O6G1L4", "B003DNLDUC", "B00B59MXGY"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4974}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PlayStation 3", "Games"]]}
