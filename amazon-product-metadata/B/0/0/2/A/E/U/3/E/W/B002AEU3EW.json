{"asin": "B002AEU3EW", "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Blank Media", "BD-R Discs"]], "description": "Verbatim BD-R LTH media is manufactured with an organic dye that turns the disc's reflectivity during recording from \"low to high\". Other BD-R discs use the \"high to low\" recording method. Additionally, BD-R LTH is manufactured on converted CD-R/DVD-R production lines which utilize a spin coating process and allow excess materials to be recycled. These two cost-cutting measures let us pass along the savings to you. Upon introduction of the BD-R LTH media, key hardware manufacturers like Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic and LG have worked to assure that their burners are fully compatible. If your BD burner is a 2009 model or later it will most likely support recording and playback of BD-R LTH media. If your Blu-ray hardware was manufactured before 2009, check with the manufacturer for firmware updates. For detailed compatibility information, see our compatibility chart.", "title": "Verbatim 96569 25 GB 2x Blu-ray Single-Layer Recordable Disc BD-R LTH (Low to High), 1-Disc (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 5.37, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Dq2yow7L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Verbatim", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003EE08S8", "B00471HK0Q", "B004477BQQ", "B009KXE4VO", "B004VS8VA8", "B004477BR0", "B0081CVAQ2", "B005AT3F1W", "B002SQKL7Q", "B005RY6JEU", "B00ACOQF2Q", "B000F7LKOI", "B004S6315S", "B005BN2AKO", "B00IQ0SCNS", "B008F5M2OY", "B007A9NSR6", "B004VSA7GO", "B003TEFWL6", "B001B98F9W", "B00AO1XFM0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003EE08S8", "B00471HK0Q", "B004S6315S", "B00699OVA6"]}}
