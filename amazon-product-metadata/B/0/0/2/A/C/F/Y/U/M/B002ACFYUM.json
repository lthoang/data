{"asin": "B002ACFYUM", "description": "Split/Second is an intense action racing game set within a reality television show.  Competitors will vie to be the first to the finish line in a made-for-TV city set rigged to blow with the ultimate goal of becoming the season champion.  Players in Split/Second don&#x2019;t just collide with other vehicles to knock them from the track, but can also trigger devastating events that drastically alter the dynamics of the race.  Players must use pinpoint timing to obliterate huge structures and towering TV set pieces to tactically alter the track or create entirely new routes.", "price": 54.59, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zlZgkPruL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000MUW98O", "B002AQLQM8", "B003O680ZY", "B003R7H5TC", "B00149V3CU", "B00488PZ2S", "B0016GABR4", "B003O65TXU", "B003O6ECOM", "B0050SWSQQ", "B001AZFSEW", "B000RI17CA", "B0093FO2TS", "B004NRN5DA", "B006JKARN0", "B001TORSHO", "B002MED6EO", "B000JLIYLC", "B000HCMR8E", "B000JHMJDA", "B002I0K6DG", "B00170BV6E", "B004Q8L46G", "B001UEN68I", "B00IGHP28Y", "B002I0K8SE", "B007SRM5U6", "B000ZK7ZMQ", "B00319DX4M", "B008OQTR3S", "B0043QQNXK", "B008YTAJLO", "B000QL0T36", "B005185SDA", "B000FII8KQ", "B0053BSOD6", "B0093FMS3U", "B000MIP72G", "B00170823O", "B004BCZLQ6", "B00CTKHZH0", "B000UC5ML0", "B006KYYOSO", "B007XYBUBE", "B0050SX3KG", "B00320JAWY", "B0057PERIY", "B0030HM2WO", "B003O6E620", "B003IMGC9U", "B000OCXK6K", "B00275A7LI", "B000WS97QI", "B004EQCCI4", "B005VKRGXI", "B003VKLA6O", "B002BRZ7JE", "B003O6FXFY", "B0048C7S5G", "B002I0K6Q8", "B002TDIEEK", "B0042GW7BI", "B0053B7ICO", "B007NUQIGK", "B003ESHRL0"], "bought_together": ["B003R7H5TC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MUW98O", "B002AQLQM8", "B006JKARN0", "B003O65TXU"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4735}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PlayStation 3", "Games"]]}
