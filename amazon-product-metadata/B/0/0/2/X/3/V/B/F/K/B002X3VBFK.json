Why do I need another? br>Built-in flashes are only effective to 8-10ft or less. This high power flash greatly extends the range!The built in flash units of digital cameras are on average effective to only about8-10 feet, and that's when your lens is at its widest-angle setting. When you want to zoom in on the action (towards the telephoto end of your zoom range) you'll find that yourbuilt in flashdoes exactlyoppositeof what you want, and itsrangeisreduced! So, when you want to use your camera's telephoto capability that you paid for, but also require the built in flash, your pictures come out dark or, even worse!The advanced slave circuitry of the Pro Digital Auto Slave Flash with Bracket Set is not fooled by the \"pre-flash\" and eliminates the need for an electrical connection to your camera.Can I use with a telephoto or wide-angle conversion lens? YES!Unlike your camera's built in flash; the flash is mounted to the side where even the largest conversion lenses will not block it. You will enjoy more even illumination and at a much greater distance, which is especially needed when working with your telephoto lens.Does it require special batteries? NO!This flash uses standard AA size (alkaline or rechargeable NiMH) batteries to power the flash for hundreds of shots.What cameras will it work with?Virtually any camera, digital or film!The Pro Digital Auto Slave Flash with Bracket Set is compatible with virtually any digital or film, point and shoot camera with a built-in flash including: Canon, Casio, Epson, Fuji, GE, HP, Kodak, Kyocera, Konica Minolta, Leica, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Polaroid, Ricoh, Samsung, Sony, Pro, Toshiba and Vivitar. can be used to improve the typically poor flash pictures taken by any Camcorder or Cell phone Camera that has a built-in electronic flash!"}
