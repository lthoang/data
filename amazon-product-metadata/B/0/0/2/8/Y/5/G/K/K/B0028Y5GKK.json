{"asin": "B0028Y5GKK", "description": "Taking advantage of its wide, 114-degree angle of view, users can easily fit subjects into the frame even when shooting indoors where the distance is limited. The world looks extraordinary when viewed through the new lens, allowing photos and movies to be recorded with a uniquely rich perspective.This high-performance lens system achieves outstanding compactness by combining 16 lens elements in 12 groups, including two aspherical lenses and four ED lenses. Image resolution is high from corner-to-corner even at the wide-angle setting. It also features F4.0 brightness over the entire zoom range thanks to its large-diameter glass molded lens elements.When mounted on the DMC-GH1 Lumix G Micro System Camera, the new lens allows use of the advanced contrast AF system, which includes a Face Recognition function, for more convenient, more enjoyable shooting. Seven blades give the aperture a rounded shape that produces an attractively smooth effect in out-of-focus areas when shooting at larger aperture settings.The Lumix G Vario 7-14mm/F4.0 ASPH. lens also features a highly reliable metal mount, and uses multi-coated lens elements that minimize ghosts and flare to further enhance its optical performance. The optimally designed lens hood enables use even under strong sunlight.MTF ChartTechnical SpecificationsLens Construction  16 elements in 12 groups (2 Aspherical lenses, 4 ED lenses)Mount  Micro Four Thirds mountOptical Image Stabilizer  NOFocal Length  f=7 mm to 14 mm (35 mm camera equivalent 14 mm to 28 mm)Aperture Type  7 diaphragm blades / Circular aperture diaphragmAperture  F4.0Minimum Aperture  F22Closest Focusing Distance  0.25 m / 0.8 ft at all focal lengthsMaximum magnification  Apporox. 0.08x / 0.15x (35 mm camera equivalent)Diagonal Angle of View  114&deg; (W) - 75&deg; (T)Filter Size  -Max.
