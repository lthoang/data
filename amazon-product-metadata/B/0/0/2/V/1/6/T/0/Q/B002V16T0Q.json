It took just an hour and a half to wipe out 3.5 billion people and 10,000 years of civilization, plunging humanity into a hopeless Dark Age. In the aftermath, survivors in Moscow moved underground and slowly organized into small socially and politically independent tribes, clustered around the city's deep, subway stations. The young man, Artyom is among them. A member of the first generation of children raised in the subterranean world following the apocalypse, he has only the vaguest recollections of life above ground, and contact with other humans beyond those that inhabit his local station, \"Exhibition,\" but he will have to face new experiences with both if humanity is to survive. Mutated beasts known as \"Dark Ones\" are spreading throughout the isolated stations of the Metro, and Artyom has been chosen as the messenger to spread the news of the new peril.", "price": 49.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pvasUGYJL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BU3WWOS", "B0053BSN82", "B0010AYJXI", "1481845705", "B002I0JA7E", "B008XMSRKC", "B001UWGDC6", "B003GSZ9ZE", "B00BS5N0IU", "B0009SQFHA", "B00F4GSAYI", "B003O6EB70", "B0050SY77E", "B0050SY9WC", "B000X1PE16", "B001ASJIRM", "B0086V5V9A", "B000R0SR9E", "B000XJNTPG", "B00163LW7A", "B00319DX4W", "B000V1OUV8", "B000CQNWH0", "B0050SYV70", "B005EZ5GNW", "B004EW7LSY", "B000SQ5LQ4", "B001REZLY8", "B00309U0M6", "B00354NAYG", "B005C2D2MO", "B0076ZPYPI", "B00BU3WVM6", "B002I0H2AG", "B00B59L9VO", "B0050SWVIQ", "B0030GBU32", "B0065NP6NC", "B00EPIHAQK", "B003P9C6QY", "B001D7T2VM", "B000HKGIOA", "B004FUL9YW", "B008E6ZXRM", "B00C3MK9BS", "B001CRQYBO", "B00149MEWI", "B000CBVC0Y", "B0014ULQB2", "B003VWGBC0", "B007UM599I", "B001YI0Z2U", "B002BSA1MQ", "B0050SYWVA", "B003O6E7AG", "B004FSE52C", "B00B59MXDM", "B0009S4UOK", "B0091D2T8S", "B0022TNO7S", "B0056WJA30", "B004NRN5DU", "B003O6G47U", "B007UM59AC", "B00320JDWG", "B008LW4SBQ", "B003H0CC2O", "B004EW948E", "B00BAWXDJM", "B006WQR3GA", "B000TI836G", "B004JSDQPU", "B00ICWO1XA", "B000FRS9II", "B00BMFIXT2", "B002BRZ8BQ", "B00CPKUS00", "B00CPKUV7K", "B007IFMFYE", "B002BRZ8FW", "B00886WO5W", "B002I0K50U", "B000WSE2WM", "B00ERDGMT4", "B0013RATNM", "B006GHA8EE", "B002WSR8BC", "B005UDTTS6", "B003S2MXRA", "B004ML7WOK", "B003O6CA64", "B0050SYY5E", "B008PQU3E4", "B002BRZ852", "B002C0VNVG", "B000XJO7A2", "B000RHZ9JI", "B002DC8GEK", "B000OLXX86", "B0088MVP2Y"], "bought_together": ["B00BU3WWOS", "B003O6EB70"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BU3WWOS", "B0053BSN82", "B00BU3WVM6", "B0065NP6NC"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5796}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Xbox 360", "Games"]]}
