{"asin": "B002VJJXGU", "description": "Drivers who rely on their GPS systems to guide their frequent travels will appreciate the all-in-one convenience of the Navi Traveler from Lowepro. It's designed to protect your valuable navigation gear from scratches, dust and abrasion, and sized to fit a GPS device and all its related accessories. The Navi Traveler features two, easy-to-access, zippered compartments. The padded upper compartment protects up to a 5-inch GPS device and includes a built-in, microfiber cloth to clean the delicate touchscreen. The thoughtfully organized lower compartment features two SD card slots on the lid and space to store a mount, charger, accessories and a manual. Customize the lower compartment with the removable/adjustable, padded divider and elastic strap - both include hook/loop fasteners to secure gear in place. The Navi Traveler offers a wide and stable base, making it ideal to sit in a center console or inside most glove compartments without slipping. A quick-grab handle offers an easy carrying option when you need to transport your GPS kit or transfer it to another vehicle. When both compartments are open, you can charge the GPS device without removing it - or the charger - for extra convenience.", "title": "Lowepro Navi Traveler Protective Case for GPS (Black)", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c2WgiYdvL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003ELOSXM"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "GPS & Navigation", "GPS System Accessories", "Cases"]]}
