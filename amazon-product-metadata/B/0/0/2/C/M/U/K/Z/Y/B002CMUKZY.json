The 6832cf mounts in place of 6 x 8 or 5 x 7-inch speakers.The Infinity Reference SeriesInfinity's Reference Series has been engineered to deliver best-in-class performance for those looking to replace or upgrade their factory speakers. Features like Infinity's Plus One (patent pending) woofer cones and edge-driven-dome tweeters have helped position Infinity Reference as the number-one line of automotive loudspeakers for the past six years straight.An ideal upgrade to your factory drivers. Mount in place of 6 x 8 or 5 x 7-inch speakers.Infinity 6832cf FeaturesPlus One woofer conesThis patent pending technology deliver a cone with more surface area than competing models of the same size. The result is increased bass output and higher efficiency.True Four OhmsAll Reference speakers feature two ohm voice coils. Original factory-installed speaker wiring in many cars is 18-22 gauge. This wire, and heating in the voice coil when power is applied, increase the impedance \"seen\" by the amplifier or head unit. The impedance of Reference Speakers has been adjusted to compensate for this increase and can be safely driven by any head unit.Edge-driven textile dome tweetersThese are not commonly used w-domes, but fully-edge-driven domes like those found in better home audio speakers. The benefit is increased power handling and reduced distortion at high output levels. This technology also allows for better integration with the mid/woofer.UnipivotInfinity's Unipivot (patent no. 6,002,780) allows the tweeter to be pointed at the listener's location even when the speaker is mounted off axis. This optimizes the stereo image and ensures a more uniform response.Tweeter level adjustmentThe 6832cf also features a tweeter level adjustment located on the front of the speaker and can be set at the reference level of 0dB. If the speakers are located low in the doors or if you are looking for a brighter sound, set the tweeter at +3dB.Rubber surroundsThis material provides optimum cone-edge suspension and absorbs distortions that may travel up the cone edge, adding stronger low-end.Infinity 6832cf SpecificationsPower Handling, RMS:60 WattsPower Handling, Peak:180 WattsSensitivity (2.83V @ 1m):93dBFrequency Response:49Hz - 21kHzImpedance:2 OhmsMounting Depth:2-3/8 inches (60mm)About InfinityInfinity was founded in 1968 on a unique blend of technology, performance, and design.
