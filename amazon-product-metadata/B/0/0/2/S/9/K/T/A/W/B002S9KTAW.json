It is comprised of two tripod stands and four 3' cross bar sections and includes a heavy duty carry bag. The four cross bar sections allow for the stand to be set up in 6', 9' or full 12' widths. The cross bar interconnects are 6\\\", the longest on the market, providing ample support for heavier backdrops. The tripod stands use air cushioned shocks, instead of spring shocks, allowing the fully extended stands to smoothly and safely collapse to their minimum height. The material on the stand bag is very heavy duty 1680D weight ballistic nylon and the zipper is 8mm white copper metal. The stand also features large ergonomic tension screws, individual elastic straps for each cross bar sections in the bag, and end caps for the crossbar to prevent tearing of your backdrops.Prism BackdropsThe backdrops are made by Prism and are professional muslin backdrops made from a heavier 100% cotton material. The 10X20' size (actually 9X18.2' after shrinkage) weighs 4.6lbs. Special dyes are used to obtain well saturated colors which appear vibrant and not washed out. All sides are stitched to avoid unravelling and a 3.4\\\" rod pocket is sewn into the top. Each muslin is folded and comes in a plastic bag to avoid moisture and stainage and then packed in a cardboard box for shipping.", "title": "Two Prism 10x20', 100% Cotton Muslin Backdrops and The Ravelli Full Size 10x12' Background Stand Set", "price": 169.69, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412J6jLRpOL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004AZ38Z0", "B003TLAMV4", "B004U5F3OE", "B0050K3DW2", "B003VCXL64", "B003TYDBYQ", "B002ZIMEMW", "B003C0ZG2W", "B002ZY4YRE", "B003WLY24O", "B001AHALEC", "B00BXA7N6A", "B001C6WW84", "B00B8JRPXC", "B004YDCWJQ", "B0019SHZU0", "B003HK2LRK", "B005DFP8GS", "B003TM600U", "B001AMOTAY", "B001SEAP1Q", "B00CXUT5ZG", "B001WB02Z4", "B004RG7Y16", "B003TY9THE", "B004YW79F4", "B000UCG502", "B00DBER276", "B003YEMSH2", "B002SWIOOM", "B00507HC9K", "B004RE3CFU", "B000ZI3TN2", "B00334VEZA", "B003PFKIEK", "B00551636O", "B001ENW61I", "B005IQSSJG", "B00DCY29G4", "B0053NWFFM", "B004MASO4I", "B00A9PB8WU", "B003Y30334", "B001196MG0", "B00009UTZA", "B0034WR71G", "B003Y31FHC", "B005HFAXIC", "B001SVJUPG", "B000BTCJNG", "B003LYURRI", "B001TSMJDS", "B002IXVRQI", "B002DDZ7OG", "B0002ER2YQ", "B001TZWFBM", "B0072B0VG8", "B004LEAYXY", "B003UOIMAS", "B00CYVNX0W", "B002S4UUMY", "B00I44F5LS", "B003TY7XJA", "B0079M711S", "B004R6NSQG", "B009RVLX1S", "B0034WR19Y", "B004TGZ7WM", "B00EE1ZH6I", "B0072B0VCM", "B00363EZY0", "B005IQRMN4", "B001KELVS0", "B000CLNHXY", "032171105X", "B003D8KV0K", "B0049XGNKK", "B0082XM7KS", "B001OKBLEE", "B004XY65WQ", "B005KEL4NI", "B00FFJ3QNO", "B00827MK3S", "B00A3DLG7A", "B0060AF8ZG", "B0090BSSZO", "B007ODZYRK", "B005JTTU1C", "B003UYEBE4", "B00GG9BFH6", "B004RQ048Q", "B00CYUAZIQ", "B0017U0WM8", "0321786610", "B00908A8PK", "B0047FHOWG", "B007FH1KX2", "B001SDU6HK"], "bought_together": ["B004AZ38Z0", "B002ZIMEMW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004AZ38Z0", "B003TLSXMO", "B002S9KDKS", "B002ZIMEMW"]}}
