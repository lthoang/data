{"asin": "B002SQKL7Q", "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Media Storage & Organization", "Disc Jewel Cases"]], "description": "Blu-ray Disc is the next-generation optical disc format that was developed to enable recording and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data. A single-layer Blu-ray Disc can hold 25GB, which can be used to record over 2 hours of HDTV. Blu-ray uses a blue-violet laser to read and write data while current optical disc technologies such as DVD use a red laser. The shorter wavelengths of the Blu-ray technology make it possible to record more data on the same space. These discs are safeguarded by Verbatim&#x2019;s super hard coat which protects against everyday wear and tear. With the rapid growth of HDTV, Blu-ray will meet the consumer demand for recording HD programming and is expected to replace VCRs and DVD recorders over the coming years.", "title": "Verbatim 96910 25 GB 6x Blu-ray Single Layer Recordable Disc BD-R, 1-Disc Jewel Case (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 8.33, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513yfq80wlL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Verbatim", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004S6315S", "B004CJ9KYC", "B003S51GUC", "B005AT3F1W", "B004K4V7V8", "B009KXE4VO", "B005BN2AKO", "B002WCOZUU", "B00465XLWO", "B00AO1XFM0", "B00DUHUPCS", "B004477BQQ", "B007A9NSR6", "B00BIYBB9Q", "B009GGC4B2", "B0056DV0L4", "B0043SEMMW", "B004VS8VA8", "B00JJGFRIQ", "B00H2GTXKS", "B008M1B3R8", "B002RT85RW", "B007VPGL5U", "B0081CVAQ2", "B006LG9R4M", "B0051UY168", "B004Q9YPYI", "B003M6AGWG", "B00AXYQGKG", "B004VSA7GO", "B008CNXXM4", "B004ZMG55I", "B00ACOQF2Q", "B004K4THQK", "B007YWMCA8", "B0074BPFW6", "B00E7B08MS", "B004SUO068", "B00IMS8MI4", "B00IQ0SCNS", "B000B018VO", "B002LU80QS", "B000GHWRIK", "B00IEX9KNI", "B00GD792US", "B0040NOWY8", "B00DPODYJC", "B00GSQ4DBM", "B004LHJD4M", "B006X2HD2M", "B0026CN0KW", "B00CW5Z4IO", "B007H30YG8", "B008MCZJXG", "B004DNA0HI", "B00DEWU3NA", "B006M6Q97O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AO1XFM0", "B009GGC4B2", "B007VPGL5U", "B0051UY168"]}}
