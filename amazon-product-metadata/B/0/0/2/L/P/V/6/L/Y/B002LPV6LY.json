The Wireless-G Range Expander is the easy way to increase the effective coverage of your wireless network. Unlike adding a traditional access point to your network to expand wireless coverage, the Wireless-G Range Expander does not need to be connected to the network by a data cable. Just put it within range of your main access point or wireless router. It is designed to \"bounce\" signals into those distant, reflective corners and hard-to-reach areas where wireless coverage is spotty and cabling is impractical. This \"relay station\" or \"repeater\" approach helps to build a wireless infrastructure and save wiring costs. Installation is a snap with the Auto Configuration button. Just plug it in and press the button. The Expander is designed to find your wireless network and configure itself automatically.", "title": "Cisco-Linksys WRE54G Wireless-G Range Expander - REFURBISHED", "price": 90.01, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 31328}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vVuYiLMhL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00021XIJW", "B0077BB3VA", "B005FDXMJS", "B00416Q5KI", "B006V72AHC", "B0007SQG5S", "B00BXKY9CQ", "B0006BA1XO", "B007HQR710"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00021XIJW", "B0077BB3VA", "B005FDXMJS", "B00416Q5KI"]}}
