A rear-side Ethernet port enables the HT-RC180 either to receive and output audio tracks  playing on your PC, or to bypass your PC and directly stream Internet radio stations. It provides five HDMI 1.3a inputs to handle a  range of high-definition video and audio sources. HDMI compatibility also enables the receiver to upscale any video input to  1080p via Faroudja DCDi Cinema. This 110W-rated receiver also features Audyssey DSX and Dolby Pro Logic IIz, two new surround sound  formats that expand the spatial dimensionality of games and movies. On top of all this, you also get Audyssey room-correction and equalization  technologies working to create a well-balanced soundstage, no matter what the volume level or shape of the room. The HT-RC180 also features  a customizable remote controller and a proprietary Universal Port that enables single-cable connection of peripheral audio devices.", "title": "Onkyo HT-RC180 7.2-Channel A/V Surround Home Network Receiver (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 16.99, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 97917}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41O0bFfQ9dL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00CLXO14K", "B007JOO4XE", "B00CILJB0E", "B004UR486G", "B00CO07C6E", "B00505F01E", "B00GXG198M", "B007JOO4YS", "B00JPJ33MO", "B00BLGUKBQ", "B003N197EI", "B007R8U5R6", "B00BLGUKEI", "B0077V8930", "B0077V88VI", "B003UES8NE", "B00BLGUKDE", "B003XDU48O", "B00JR6GJLW", "B004U403WM", "B008CXTX5U", "B00CAAQHBE", "B00EE18O7W", "B00IQ0SE22", "B00CALM17C", "B004VK0IOS", "B0054N9RQQ", "B00005T3C8", "B00IQ0SDVY", "B00B981F4M", "B004QR56R0", "B000GU78Z4", "B004QR56SE", "B005E1HWN8", "B00EXTVPOE", "B000092TT0", "B00BQHCC48", "B009HB2USI", "B00B981F1U", "B00JRTMOGS", "B00B981F2Y", "B004NHCGJO", "B00B981F2O", "B00BKXCKRC", "B00IK4DUB4", "B000CES1RS", "B00CMNZFU8", "B00JU1R39G", "B004O0TRD8", "B001W3FXAQ", "B00829USIU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0093F4ROI", "B0077V88W2", "B006U3O566", "B007JOO4YS"]}}
