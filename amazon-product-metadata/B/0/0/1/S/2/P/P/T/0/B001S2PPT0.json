The ring type SWM offers quiet AF operation. Although all lens groups shift during focusing, the front element and filter mount do not rotate and the barrel length does not change, which is useful when using filter mounted SB-R200 Wireless Remote Speedlight units.The AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G optical design allows a different look and feel to images taken with zoom lenses, and its dimensions are ideal for discrete snapshots and landscape shooting with a picture angle that approximates that of the human eye. With its rounded seven-blade diaphragm opening, out-of-focus elements appear more natural. When mounted on a DX-format SLR, the picture angle is the 35mm equivalent focal length of 50mm.The AF-S Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G has two focus modes, M/A (manual override autofocus) and M (manual focus). The M/A mode enables instant manual switching during AF operation. The lens also features a rubber seal to minimize moisture ingression around the mount and can focus down to 0.3 meters (0.98 ft).AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G Lens HighlightsFast, f/1.8 prime lens is perfect for low-light conditions, travel, environmental portrait and general photographyEngineered for Nikon DX-format D-SLRS, the AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G lens renders a picture angle approximating the classic normal angle of view of a 50mm lens on a Nikon FXformat digital SLR or 35mm film cameraAspherical lens element minimizes coma and other types of lens aberrations, further improving image integrityNikon Super Integrated Coating (SIC) enhances light transmission efficiency and offers color consistency and reduced flareExclusive Nikon Silent Wave Motor (SWM) enables fast, accurate and quiet autofocusClose focusing to 1 foot for creative perspectives and versatilityRounded 7-blade diaphragm opening makes out-of-focus elements appear more naturalAccepts 52mm filter attachments"}
