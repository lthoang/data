The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed.iSAPS Technologyis an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.AFace Detection Self-Timerautomatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer&rsquo;s face in a group shot, there&rsquo;s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer&rsquo;s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing.Intelligent Contrast CorrectionDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated.Red-eye Correctionprovides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.2) The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them.Life doesn&rsquo;t give you second chances to capture special times. That&rsquo;s why the PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode.What's in the BoxPowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH bodyLithium-ion battery pack (NB-4L)Battery charger (CB-2LV)Wrist strap (WS-DC7)Digital Camera Solution CD-ROMUSB interface cable (IFC-400PCU)AV cable (AVC-DC400)", "title": "Canon PowerShot SD780IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Silver)", "price": 299.0, "salesRank": {"Camera &amp; Photo": 5084}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hW7WMxPJL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000Q30420", "B001G5ZTN6", "B0015DPJ5W", "B0035FZJJ4", "B0035FZJKI", "B001SER48S", "B001SER492", "B0015DNIKU", "B001SER49M", "B0075SUII4", "B0075SUIEI", "B00I58LVKC", "B00I58LZRG", "B00AWYN0BU", "B00HLDFPA4", "B00AWYN182", "B004HW73S4", "B00B5HE3AK", "B00HLDFNKQ", "B00B5HE3YG", "B00I58M192", "B0035FZJJO", "B00AWYN0ME", "B0075T7NW2", "B00I58LXVY", "B00B5HE3UU", "B006UMM1AY", "B000NK8EWI", "B001SER4A6", "B00HLDIDVM", "B00B5HE3IW", "B0035FZJKS", "B0035FZJJE", "B001SER46K", "B006UMM15O", "B000NK6J6Q", "B006UMM1PO", "B0011ZK6PC", "B0075SUHGC", "B005II5OLY", "B00B5HE45E", "B006UMM1F4", "B0075SUJH4", "B00AWYMXZY", "B001SER46A", "B0075SUK14", "B0075SUHA8", "B0075SUFLE", "B0075SUJQK", "B0075SUFSC", "B000AYKUUQ", "B0075SUG3Q", "B001G5ZTWM", "B006UMM1UO"], "bought_together": ["B003VNKNEQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003VNKNF0", "B003VNKNEQ", "B007BJHETS", "B005HNF01O"]}}
