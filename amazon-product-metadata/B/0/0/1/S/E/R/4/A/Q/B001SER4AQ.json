This 12.1-megapixel digital camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends you&rsquo;ll be proud to display. The high-resolution images taken by the PowerShot A1100 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches.The PowerShot A1100 IS has a 4x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a closer shot of a landscape, or a child&rsquo;s big smile.The PowerShot A1100 IS is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you&rsquo;ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash.A World of Advantages with Canon&rsquo;s TechnologyThe DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer.DIGIC 4 Image ProcessorCanon&rsquo;s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed.iSAPS Technologyis an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.AFace Detection Self-Timerautomatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer&rsquo;s face in a group shot, there&rsquo;s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer&rsquo;s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing.Intelligent Contrast CorrectionDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot A1100 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated.Red-eye Correctionprovides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2) The PowerShot A1100 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. 3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them.Life doesn&rsquo;t give you second chances to capture special times. That&rsquo;s why the PowerShot A1100 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility.
