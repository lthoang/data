The player works with 8 different Car-Tridges (one comes with the controller, 7 are sold separately). Each Car-Tridge, when loaded into the controller, shows up on screen and enables a boy to race with all the attributes of that exact car. Each car works best in one of 8 environments in the 3D game, so choose the best Car-Tridge and conquer each level of the game to become the ultimate Xtreme Racer."}
