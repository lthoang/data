This sensor allows images to be interpolated to reach 2 megapixel quality.30x optical zoomThe TH1 delivers HD video and 30x optical zoom.  The lens provides a fantastic zooming range from F=43-1290 mm (35mm equivalent).12 Subject Face Chaser TechnologyRecognizes up to 12 faces for videos and still pictures and optimizes focus and aperture settings to ensure all subjects are in focus.Sophisticated image stabilizerUsing a proprietary Sanyo algorithm, the TH1 automatically compensates for distracting up-and-down or side-to-side camera movement, keeping your subject steady and easy to follow. It accurately distinguishes between unintentional camera shake and deliberate camera movement. This handy feature operates in both wide-angle and telephoto modes.Sequential photo mode shoots up to 13 frames per secondTake pictures like the pros with sequential shooting up to 13 fps.

In fact, the file size can be up to 25 percent smaller than that of typical MPEG-4 cameras.To accomplish the complexity of encoding AVC/H.264 in real-time on the TH1, a dedicated H.264 video compression IC was incorporated into the camera that was designed specifically for portable consumer devices.  This achieves high video quality while simultaneously reducing the system power consumption.Easily transfer video and still images to your video capable iPodImport video and still image files directly into iTunes software and then port them to your video-capable iPod.
