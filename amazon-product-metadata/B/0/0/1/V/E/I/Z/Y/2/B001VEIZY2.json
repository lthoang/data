{"asin": "B001VEIZY2", "description": "The Benro Aluminium Travel Angel Kit TRA168 is a professional-quality tripod kit that uses lightweight high rigidity aluminum alloy. In addition, magnesium is used for all die-cast parts. Despite its lower weight, magnesium is more rugged than aluminum, and has the same strength per volume. The tripod comes fully-featured, and is precisely machined to offer the quality and strength demanded by professional photographers. Travel Angel A-series tripods feature individual leg angle adjustments, anti-rotation leg design, a reversible center column with spring loaded weight hook, dust and moisture resistant rubber leg lock grips. This tripod features a 180 degree folding mechanism, where the legs totally cover-up the top plate and \"spider\", and which accommodates the head inside the folded tripod legs. This allows it to fold up to 20 percent smaller than conventional designed tripods. The kit includes a matching single action ballhead with calibrated panning base, locked down by a single lock-down lever, and a dual quick release locking system. The Anti-twist leg sections and a grooved center column make setup and breakdown quick and easy. The removable rubber feet provide a secure grip on smooth surfaces and the optional stainless steel spiked feet are ideal for use outdoors. A retractable spring-loaded hook can be used to add stability with a sand bag or equipment bag. Includes Deluxe Carry Case.", "title": "Benro TRA168 Magnesium-Aluminium 4 Section Travel Angel Kit with Quick Release, Supports 8.8 lbs", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oLUTunRLL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003II3FD0", "B009X2OS5Y"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Tripods & Monopods", "Complete Tripods"]]}
