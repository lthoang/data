A side benefit is that cable clutter is also eliminated by running a single HDMI cable to your HDTV from a switch and relocating the HDMI ports to a concealed location. The problem with most HDMI switches is that you have to either get up to push a button, or hunt for the remote control, to switch sources. The true mark of any great switching component is an ability to perform its function and remain transparent in its operation. This automatic HDMI switch is a plug-and-play away from offering everything you are looking for in an HDMI switch. Select a single output from up to three devices for signal delivery to your HDTV. Smart operation provides complete control for connect-and-forget operation. Powering on a device gives it output priority over the other devices. By powering down the device in use, output priority is returned to the last powered on device. Note: Auto switch function only works for components that do not output continuous voltage over HDMI port when turned off.
