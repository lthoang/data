{"asin": "B001BK54RM", "description": "Tired of losing your keys, wallet, or remote control every time you turn around? Turn to the Easy 2 Find radio-frequency locator, a convenient, high-quality gadget that finds up to four missing items in seconds. The Easy 2 Find comes with two key ring receivers, two thin receiver plates with double-sided adhesive tape (for wallets, remotes, etc.), and a single radio transmitter with four buttons. Should you lose an item, simply click the color-coded button on the transmitter and listen for the beep and look for the flash from the corresponding receiver. The transmitter can find items up to 60 feet away, and is powerful enough to penetrate walls, cushions, leather sofas, closet doors, and more. Now you'll never lose sight of your keys or wallet again. The only trick is to remember where you put the transmitter. The Easy 2 Find--which comes with all the necessary batteries--transmits on the 433.92 MHz frequency and offers a volume level of 90 to 95 dB. The bundle also includes an extra set of batteries for each item.", "title": "Click n Dig Key Finder Wireless RF Item Locator Remote Control, Pet, Wallet, Keyfinder-Free Extra Batteries", "price": 28.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31hwTSl8M%2BL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009JJKZSK", "B003N3J6BU", "B008R0FQT0", "B003N3J6F6", "B001TLEXES", "B0030F27EO", "B0077I42S4", "B0050VGZLM", "B009NUQWYG"], "bought_together": ["B009JJKZSK", "B0042A9UXC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JJKZSK", "B009JJJ7S4", "B009JJEPJ0", "B0030F27EO"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Remote Controls", "TV Remote Controls"]]}
