Compare to major brands..While finding a Wii system isn't out of the question this holiday season, getting your hands on component cables has been nearly impossible, with the connectors MIA at most retailers so far and occasionally sold out on Nintendo's own website. At times like these we must take matters into our own hands. We've made our own cables before but this time you'll have to follow the lead of the NFG forums, and MacGyver a connection together; since the composite cable included with the system doesn't have all the pins necessary, some clever modders have resorted to paper clip stand ins. We don't know how well this will work as a long term solution, but if you're waiting the long two weeks or so before the official cables hit store shelves this should definitely hit the spot.", "price": 17.69, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f1DwLONcL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017QFMJU", "B0018QOWEU", "B001EBLQ70", "B001FAAC3E", "B001TK9SEE", "B007PY3ZPG", "B004IK24MU", "B0011E4J2Y", "B0013OL0BK", "B0013OM528", "B0087OYB38", "B004MNDCTC", "B001ID829O", "0739083236", "B0052SCU8U", "B002BRZ9G0", "B002KCKX8K", "B003L1ZYYM", "B00005MDZD", "B001GIUWX0", "B002P4KXFG", "B000LFJNF2", "B002OL1KEI", "B003WY86NE", "B002672Z80", "B001PO2BJI", "B004JKZUJI", "B000FQ9QVI", "B004TC13JC", "B00005RH4D", "B002GEKIOG", "B002L8W5V6", "B004VPRY04", "B003YC4D9A", "B002MGPAKU", "B0033QISHU", "B000FQ9R4E", "B004C34D2M", "B003S55EWI", "B005QWH4QA", "9861019731"], "bought_together": ["B0017QFMJU", "B0018QOWEU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OFSBL6", "B000M4KIME", "B000NU9VPW", "B0011E4J2Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5562}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Cables & Interconnects", "Video Cables", "Composite Video"]]}
