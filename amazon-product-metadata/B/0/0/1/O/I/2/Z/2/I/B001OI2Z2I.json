You can also use higher capacity memory cards to further increase the video storage of your VIXIA HF200. It's a fast and simple way to share your memories.The advantages of Flash Memory go beyond the added recording time. You'll also appreciate the quick response time, because it doesn't have to wait for moving parts. Press the record button and your VIXIA HF200 starts recording video faster than you've ever seen before. In addition, when you review your footage, it will come up more quickly as well.Another plus is the VIXIA HF200's low power consumption rate, allowing your battery to last longer. It's just what you need so you don't miss that pivotal play on the field or the moment when they say \"I do.\"While we certainly hope you keep your VIXIA HF200 securely in your hand while shooting, if it happens to slip, or you accidentally knock it against something, you'll be happy to know that Flash Memory makes your camcorder more shock resistant than other recording storage systems. It also minimizes the chance of data loss due to damage to your recording media or the moving parts found in other camcorders.* 1920 x 1080 movie recording requires a Class 4 or higher memory card. For other recording formats, a Class 2 or higher card is recommended. Also, movie recording requires cards with 128MB of memory or more. Cards made by Toshiba, SanDisk or Matsushita are recommended. No particular restrictions apply for still images.Ultra-Sleek, Compact and Lightweight DesignMaking the technology and features of the VIXIA HF200 even more impressive is its compact size and lightweight design.

You will find more places than ever to use your VIXIA HF200 because it's so easy to have with you more of the time.Genuine Canon 15x HD Video LensFor over 70 years Canon has been producing exceptional photographic lenses that are synonymous with unsurpassed optical performance. Because of Genuine Canon Optics, every Canon broadcast lens, 35mm film camera, digital camera and camcorder assures brilliant optical quality - and the VIXIA HF200 is no exception.The VIXIA HF200 comes with an outstanding High Definition video lens - a Genuine Canon 15x HD Video Lens. It's the lens you need to record long shots of your child on the soccer field, wide shots of beautiful landscapes, and everything in-between. And because it comes with four zoom speeds, three pre-set and one variable, you always get smooth, steady, professional-looking zoom shots.Super Spectra Coating technology results in images with minimal flare and ghosting. Plus, the new lens' aspheric design reduces aberration and increases resolution, ensuring crisp, sharp video - enhancing the HD image quality. Additionally, a gradation neutral density (ND) system gives you better exposures in bright shooting situations.Canon Exclusive: 3.89-megapixel Full HD CMOS Image SensorThe VIXIA HF200 captures 1920 x 1080 High Definition video through its Canon designed and manufactured 3.89-megapixel HD CMOS image sensor, similar to the CMOS image sensors in Canon's EOS Series Digital SLR cameras.The VIXIA HF200's sophisticated CMOS image sensor provides high color resolution and advanced color reproduction for brilliant results. It is also unique in featuring Canon's proprietary noise reduction technologies for crisp, sharp images. Low noise technology also means that even in dimly lit scenes, the signal from each pixel is as pure as possible, with minimal noise or other aberrations. It's the ideal sensor for HD.The VIXIA HF200 uses an RGB Primary Color Filter with Bayer Placement Pattern that separates light into red, green and blue color components. This results in vibrant images with deep, rich, accurate color and natural-looking tones similar to what you'd obtain from 3CCD camcorders. In addition, the Bayer Placement Pattern delivers sharp, high definition images with true-to-life color reproduction. As an added benefit, the CMOS sensor provides outstanding image capture in low light conditions.Canon Exclusive: DIGIC DV III Image ProcessorDIGIC DV III is Canon's most advanced HD image processor ever, helping to deliver enhanced image quality, true color production for both video and photos, and a sophisticated noise reduction system for exceptional low-light performance. It is also the high-speed engine which powers a variety of new Canon technologies including Genuine Canon Face Detection and a new Advanced Auto Exposure system.Plus, the Canon DIGIC DV III Image Processor allows continuous shooting of digital photos with the VIXIA HF200. You can also enjoy faster processing of your images to your memory card (1.4x normal card; 2.5x Hi Speed card). In addition, it helps lower power consumption for longer battery life.1920 x 1080 Full HD RecordingThe Canon VIXIA HF200 not only captures images in Full HD, but records and outputs at 1920 x 1080* as well, so you get Full HD from lens to screen. Your memories are preserved in stunning clarity, and ready for playback on your HDTV. With the advanced codec in the VIXIA HF200, you can also record at the highest AVCHD bitrate of 24Mbps.***A Class 4 or higher SDHC memory card is required. For other recording formats, a Class 2 or higher card is recommended. Also, movie recording requires cards with 128MB of memory or more. Cards made by Toshiba, SanDisk or Matsushita are recommended. No particular restrictions apply for still images.**DVD media containing AVCHD footage should only be used in AVCHD compatible players otherwise the DVD player may fail to eject the media and may erase its contents without warning.24Mbps RecordingThe 24Mbps recording capability of the VIXIA HF200 gives you the highest quality AVCHD video possible. You'll see enhanced detail, finer gradations of tones and improved reproduction of moving subjects. Video shot by the VIXIA HF200 of fast-moving sporting events, multi-color butterflies on a variegated leaf or the shading of a brilliant sunset will be remarkable.Canon Exclusive: SuperRange Optical Image StabilizationThe high-resolution images of High Definition video demand a steady hand. It's easier to get those clear, steady images with the VIXIA HF200, thanks to Canon's innovative SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization. It combines gyro- and image-sensors to give image stabilization through a wider range of camera motions. Some image stabilization systems correct one type of camera motion or vibration better than another. But Canon's SuperRange OIS corrects for a wide range of camcorder motion: the fast vibration you'd experience while recording from a moving car; the medium-speed motion of hand-held recording; and the slower motion of body sway. No matter what you're recording and how you're recording it, the VIXIA HF200's stabilization design corrects camcorder shake instantly. SuperRange OIS also delivers steady images when shooting at long focal lengths.SuperRange OIS in action.In addition, optical stabilization keeps your shot steady without a loss in image quality - something that can't be said for electronic image stabilization. And image stabilization isn't just for video; you can even use it for taking sharper, clearer digital photographs with your VIXIA HF200. Thanks to Canon's expertise, it's easy to eliminate one of the telltale signs of amateur video and photography.Canon Exclusive: Instant AF (Auto Focus)Another critical objective when shooting in High Definition is achieving a very sharp focus. The VIXIA HF200 camcorder features Canon's revolutionary Instant AF focusing system which offers a dramatic improvement in auto focus speed and accuracy (compared to traditional auto focus systems). The Instant AF feature uses an external sensor, in combination with Canon's auto focus system, to help significantly decrease the time it takes to find focus, even in low light conditions. This system achieves focus instantaneously, reducing focus \"hunting.\" The benefits of Instant AF are especially seen in high brightness and night shooting situations. With Instant AF, it's possible to capture fast, accurate focusing, even when following a moving subject.And because a properly focused subject is more critical than ever with HD, the VIXIA HF200 also features Focus Assist. This helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject (when you start recording, this assistance is automatically cancelled). This is a feature normally found in professional broadcast-quality cameras.Canon Exclusive: Genuine Canon Face DetectionThe same high quality Face Detection technology used in Canon digital cameras is now available in Canon High Definition camcorders. Up to 35 faces can be detected automatically, and 9 detection frames can be displayed at one time. Genuine Canon Face Detection ensures razor-sharp focus and natural, accurate exposure of the chosen subjects.The system is in fact so intelligent that it will recognize faces that are turned downwards or sideways. In addition, a specific face may be selected as the main subject for continuous tracking. This feature can be used to search for clips featuring that specific subject's face. In search and playback, use of the Face Index will display frames with the chosen face as a thumbnail in each shot in which it appears. The selected face can be linked as a timeline to further identify footage containing that subject.Advanced Auto Exposure SystemThe VIXIA HF200 has an Advanced AE System designed to provide the most accurate exposure settings in a wide variety of lighting conditions. This enhanced Auto Exposure, together with Genuine Canon Face Detection and DIGIC DV III, captures an expanded dynamic range, optimizing brightness to avoid overexposure, while still preserving precious shadow detail.24p Cinema Mode24p Cinema Mode enables all aspiring moviemakers to achieve a professional \"film-look.\" You can change the camcorder's frame capture rate to 24p (recorded at 60i), which provides the appearance of the same frame rate as movie film. In addition, you can use the VIXIA HF200's CINEMA setting, which changes the color and tonal characteristics, evoking the look and feel of a movie shown in a theater. For added flexibility, these settings can be used together or independently.Normal mode vs. Cinema mode30p Progressive ModeYou would otherwise have to look to professional video cameras in order to have this sophisticated tool at your command. In addition to the standard interlaced video frame rate of 60i, you may choose to set the VIXIA HF200 to capture video in 30p (30 progressive frames, recorded to 60i), which is particularly useful for footage to be used on the Internet. In addition, this setting gives enhanced quality to still images captured after recording. It's also excellent for action shots and sports.60i vs. 30pCanon Exclusive: 2.7-inch Multi-Angle Vivid Widescreen LCDThe 2.7-inch Multi-Angle Vivid Widescreen LCD on the VIXIA HF200 lets you see more of what your camcorder is recording. Using a hard coat Anti-Reflection surface and improved color reproduction, the scene in the viewfinder is a more accurate indication of what you're capturing in the camcorder. An added benefit of this Canon Exclusive is the wider range of viewing angle possible with this LCD screen. With less glare and deeper contrasts, groups of people can gather around it and see the image displayed more clearly than ever before.Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe TerminalAnother pro-level feature of the VIXIA HF200 is the Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe on the camcorder. At about half the size of Canon's Advanced Accessory shoe, this feature allows you to attach available Canon optional accessories, such as the VL-5 accessory video light or DM-100 directional stereo microphone. Using the proper accessories can greatly enhance the production values of the video you shoot.Video Snapshot ModeThe Video Snapshot Mode of the VIXIA HF200 will let you shoot short movie clips in the same way you've shot snapshots with your still camera. Simply capture a series of 4-second video clips, blend in one of 10 supplied music tracks, or your favorite background music, and create an entertaining movie that will hold everyone's attention. It's the perfect way to document your vacation or a family milestone.Video Snapshot modeSuperb Shooting ControlDual ShotDual ShotCapture video and photos without switching modes, which saves you time and helps you avoid the chance of a missed shot.Variable Zoom Speed ControlAnother sure sign of amateur video is the unsteady zoom shot. But with the VIXIA HF200's zoom control, you simply select one of the four zoom speeds (three pre-set, one variable) for smooth, steady, professional-looking zooms.Level and Grid MarkersWith the Level Marker feature, it's easy to keep your camera level for more professional-looking video. Line up any horizontal lines in your shot - such as the horizon - to the marker and you can be sure your camcorder is level.The VIXIA HF200's Grid Marker feature lets you compose your shot accurately, according to the grid on your LCD screen. You can even choose from two different colors for the grid. This ensures that you see the grid, no matter what the background color of your shot is.Quick StartNever miss a quickly unfolding shot again. When the VIXIA HF200 is in Camera Mode and the LCD panel is closed, it is placed in standby mode. When the action starts, open the LCD panel and you'll begin recording in less than one second.

When you press the shooting button while in Pre-record, the VIXIA HF20 automatically records 3 seconds of the action which occurred prior to your pressing of the button. With Pre-record, it will be easier than ever to capture the moment when the bat hits the ball at the start of that home run.Pre-record modeLow Light PerformanceSome of the most magical shots are taken at the end of the day or long after the sun has set. You won't miss any of them, thanks to the VIXIA HF200's mini video light. The light lets you shoot subjects in color, in low light, up to 4.9 feet away. So, whether it's a shot of a sleeping baby, or a group of friends on a candle-lit terrace at night, the VIXIA HF200 captures all the moments you want to record.Manual Audio Level ControlTo make your videos sound as good as they look, the VIXIA HF200 offers a built-in audio meter and manual audio level adjustment. You'll be able to tell at a glance if the sound you're hearing is being recorded the way you want it and a simple control allows you to change the audio level if it's not.Improved Menu User InterfaceFor greater ease of use, the VIXIA HF200 features a revised control button with cross movement action.
