Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.", "price": 19.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eedc%2BlVfL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00149NCYW", "B0015HZLVA", "B001CMJAP6", "B000ZJVDA2", "B000PC4FYK", "B000QW9D14", "B003O6EBRA", "B002BRWUA8", "B0028A6V7Q", "B001CMIUYS", "B00319DX4W", "0744011035", "B002BRUTT2", "B0044SA70M", "B000FUG5WC", "B0002GTFIK", "B000FLZEXM", "B004P6IVPQ", "B003O6G6G4", "B000P8WOMO", "B0016NRS8M", "B000HGMH12", "B0019GZ93M", "B002W5GI9I", "B004JHJHCC", "B00946FSJ4", "B00B59MXDM", "B001YI0Z2U", "B004Q4CZY0", "B003FBL85W", "B004XLA1OW", "B004A88W8K", "B001D7T2VM", "B000R0SS3Y", "B004NRN5DU", "B0054INKZK", "B000G0JD9I", "B001IKHVTE", "B007FMSH4W", "B003KT0ACG", "B004EW7LSY", "B008XMSRKC", "B000FRVAD4", "B002I0JA7E", "B003O6E9EK", "B002GPPPS4", "B002C0VNVG", "B005VBVQAG", "B002BRZ8FW", "B0019VMEN0", "B0058VI0SU", "B007IFMFYE", "B001D25M1Q", "B0043B5SLI", "B0056WJA30", "B0047TG2R0", "B0065NP6NC", "B0010AYJXI", "B006GHA8EE", "B001UWGDC6", "B0013TLQH8", "B003O6HGHM", "B007UM59AC", "B002I0J4AM", "B002I08WVY", "B004FSE52C", "B00ICWO1XA", "B002I0JGDM", "B000ICV996", "B00D7NQP9M", "B002QK00OI", "B001IK1BJ0", "B00CBNV7UQ", "B005FDUSTA", "B002Q21X7Y", "B007UMD1EI", "B003O6EA4E", "B00309U0M6", "B0050SY9WC", "B004Q4EQ4M", "B0042VX73U", "B003S2MXRA", "B0050SY4DG", "B004VMX81G", "B001NX4DUQ", "B000P297E8", "B000WCN7G0", "B004L9WGDA", "B00BU3WWOS", "B005J5K9EI", "B002I0H79C", "B00HV0MNKW", "B00DBCAT3W", "B000NNFJQY", "B007B7BI8S", "B003PHLTDC", "B0016C3260", "B003WY86NE", "B005C2D2MO", "B001REZLY8"], "bought_together": ["B0015HZLVA", "B000QW9D14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I0J4AM", "B0015HZLVA", "B003O6EBRA", "B000ZJVDA2"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 3520}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Xbox 360", "Games"]]}
