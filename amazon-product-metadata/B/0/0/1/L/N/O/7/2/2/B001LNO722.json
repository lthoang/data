These days, we spend a lot of time listening to music with headphones. Every minute you spend enjoying your music should be the best it can be, but ordinary headphones can't deliver the rich dynamics, full range, and emotional impact of your favorite music.Sound So Incredible, We Had to Call Them In-Ear Speakers Monster Turbines truly deliver the big sound, power, and clarity that you'd expect from full size high-end speakers. That's why we had to call them speakers, not headphones.Bass So Deep, it Sounds Like There's a Subwoofer Unlike other headphones that can't reproduce deep bass, Monster Turbines accurately reproduce even the lowest bass notes without distortion. You'll hear thunderous low-end for incredible sound with every kind of music,from the thumping bass beats of hip hop tracks to the deepest pipe organ notes in classical compositions. Less Noise, More Music. We live in a noisy world that can interfere with your listening. Monster Turbines include multiple sound isolating ear-tips to give you a perfect fit that seals out unwanted noise for a pure listening experience.Secure, Comfortable Fit for Active Lifestyles In-ear headphones give you total freedom to move for life on-the-go. But they don't always stay where they are or even in your ear, especially if you're working out. Monster's ear hooks keep your headphones firmly in place. They're lightweight, easy to wear and remove, and easily bend to fit your ear's shape.", "title": "Monster Turbine High Performance In-Ear Speakers (127593) - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 117.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PlhNHQFAL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Monster", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TFEHMA", "B002NTMHU2", "B002NTKV5A", "B004923LQK", "B0057FOD4W", "B0057FOC3Y", "B002EL4RIO", "B002EL4RIE", "B0057X4TWA", "B004444O5A", "B0057FOBJ4", "B009W98CXM", "B002UXRED6", "B007IZNM1O", "B004SNCZ3K", "B003I65U12", "B0097LY7Y8", "B00A0I97RY", "B004444O6E", "B0019FLMVG", "B006VJQ2OM", "B001A62M04", "B009OYUFMG", "B005SSWKMK", "B003V32UDI", "B005LAIFE2", "B004444O5U", "B004LKRTD6", "B004444O64", "B005OVCF8U", "B009E55WL4", "B008EQTI0K", "B007VL8Z9O", "B004WIR1NA", "B000UV0MJS", "B00GYATOS4", "B002ODUEDO", "B00858I4M0", "B002OSY3WW", "B0030O0Q2U", "B0044WWLW0", "B000CMTV3I", "B00134JNJG", "B005MKGOOY", "B003V360NY", "B003YJAZZ4", "B003URWNQE", "B004444OFK", "B00IS8RZ18", "B007RWZHXO", "B002C741NQ", "B006VJOOHE", "B00284ADAI", "B00HY7DST2", "B001V9LPT4", "B006ZAHNHC", "B00DD62ZW4", "B004444O50", "B00BOTPPL0", "B004444O4G", "B001EZUQ5E", "B008CS5T76", "B004444O46", "B002JIMZU4", "B005L38QK2", "B004P8AF30", "B002N5MHLK", "B00AJNKBAW", "B005MRMU0O", "B005ES6E6W", "B00001P4ZH", "B008CS9O8Q", "B004PNZFZ8", "B002EVPSXW", "B001FWXKMM"], "bought_together": ["B003TFEHMA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EZYMF4", "B004PNZFZ8", "B00A0I97RY", "B009W98CXM"]}}
