The Lightscoop is the inexpensive answer to natural-looking bounce flash and digital photography lighting. (Even professionals like it for casual shooting!) No more harsh shadows, bleached faces, red-eye, or cave effect from direct pop-up flash! Reviewers tell the story: \"Bounce pop-up flash by snapping a Lightscoop over it, a little piece of plastic genius,\" Popular Photography, March 2008 \"...just as if you had used one of those reflector umbrellas that the pros use,\" David Pogue, New York Times, \"Circuits.\" -- \"It slips into your camera's hot shoe, fits right over the pop up flash, and redirects the camera's flash to a ceiling or wall. That's bounce, baby, bounce... as essential as a lens cap,\" DingbatMag, the monthly review of Cool Tools \"Your pop-up flash doesn't have to suck... I was stunned by the difference,\" Terry White's Tech Blog The Standard version has a normal mirror and is used in most situations.
