So, either heating or cooling the back yard with an old fashioned pet door just won't do anymore. In some cases the energy waste is like opening and closing the door itself 4 or 5 times a day.  Ideal Pet has the answer with The Ruff-Weather Door's air pocket between 2 soft flaps, making it a great energy efficient insulator.  The Ruff-Weather series in Small, Medium, Extra Large and Super Large are designed to give an air pocket of up to 3 inches between the 2 flaps in a door installation. And with the available wall tunnel kit, an air pocket of up to 9 inches. This is serious energy efficiency"}
