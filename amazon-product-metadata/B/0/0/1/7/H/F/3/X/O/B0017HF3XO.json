With the Belkin Mini Surge Protector you no longer have to choose what to charge first.This surge protector acts as a power strip, letting you plug three AC devices into a single wall outlet. It is rated to handle 918 Joules and provides protection against power surges and spikes, since the smart traveler is looking for protection of essential gear and irreplaceable data, not just extra outlets.Two Powered USB Outlets Let You Charge More Devices EasilyIn addition to its three AC outlets, this surge protector features two protected, powered USB outlets, so you can easily charge your iPod along with other USB devices. These USB outlets do not transmit data and the surge protector cannot be used as a hub, but they do make it exceptionally easy to keep devices that are charged via USB interfaces up and running without blocking your computer's USB ports or the AC outlets that you need for bigger devices.Plus you may be able to leave long, tangle-friendly cords and clunky item-specific chargers at home, since this mini surge protector comes with a mini-USB cable. This is especially convenient now that many phones, including Blackberries and Motorola RAZR phones, feature USB power connections.Unique, Efficient Design with Rotating Plug for Added VersatilityIts compact, lightweight, and efficient design means that you can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on, and because Belkin knows that working on the road often means trying to plug in despite awkward outlet or furniture positioning, a 360-degree rotating plug with four locking positions makes it easy to use this device in tight spaces.About Belkin International, Inc.Belkin offers a diverse product mix that provides people with seamless electronics integration in their homes, cars, and on the go.
