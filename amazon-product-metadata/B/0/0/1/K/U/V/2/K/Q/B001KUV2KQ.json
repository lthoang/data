{"asin": "B001KUV2KQ", "description": "Challenging a new generations of PC mod-ding, the Cooler Master V8 revs up ahead with its tough guard cooling engine. Superior in its design, this wicked-fun V8 monster has enough horsepower to out-perform its duties with any high-performance CPU while under the most critical heat conditions. On top of its stylish finish, the V8 Cooler has quite some rich features. For heat dissipation it is supported with it's smart 180W cooling solution. Modularized by 4 separate set of aluminium fins and linked by 8 diagonal up-rise heat pipes, the V8 structural design allows speedy heat transfer to a large heat dissipation surface. Another excellent key feature of the V8, is its precision fan control. The V8 is compatible with all current CPU sockets, and provides unsurpassed cooling performance.The V8 certainly is one of Cooler Master's innovative hallmark.&nbsp;The Ultimate 180W Air Cooling Solution4 separate modular sets of aluminum fins create a large heat dissipation surface for unsurpassed cooling performance8 heat pipes maximize heat transferMirror-finished base makes for 100% contact with the processor&nbsp;4 sets of modular aluminum fins8 high performance heat pipesMirror-finished base&nbsp;Optimum AirflowThe center mounted 120mm fan blows cool air through the fins of the heatsink and cools down the heatsink which is taking the heat away from the CPU smoothly&nbsp;Precision Control and Quiet Operation at 17~21 dBAAdjustable PWM fan speed control, using a manual knob placed in the back of the chassis, enables fan adjustments from 7V to 12V, allowing users to find the perfect balance between cooling performance and noise levelMain unit with PWM and Fan Speed ControllerFan Speed Controller is installed into PCI slot&nbsp;ModelRR-UV8-XBU1-GPCPU SocketSupports Intel sockets LGA 1366/1155/775 and AMD sockets AM3/AM2+/AM2CPU SupportIntel: Core 2 Extreme, Core 2 Quad, Core 2 Duo, Pentium Extreme Ed., Pentium Dual-Core, Pentium D, Pentium 4 Extreme Ed., Pentium 4 HT, Pentium 4, Celeron Dual-Core, Celeron DAMD:Phenom, Athlon 64 X2, Athlon X2, SempronDimension120 x 128 x 161.1mmWeight1.91 lbsHeat Sink Dimensions120 x 120 x 158mmHeat Sink MaterialCopper Base / Aluminum Fins / 8 Heat PipesHeat Pipes Dimensions6mmFan Dimension (W / H / D)120 x 120 x 25mmFan Speed800 - 1800RPMFan Airflow69.69CFMAir pressure (mmH2O)2.94mm H2OBearing TypeRifle BearingFan Life Expectancy40,000hrsFan Noise Level (dB-A)17 - 21dBAFan Speed AdjustmentInstall on PCI SlotConnector4-pinFan ControlPWM + VR ControllerRated Voltage12VStart Voltage7VOperating Voltage10.38V - 13.2VRated Current0.12AInput Power1.44W", "title": "Cooler Master V8 - CPU Cooler with 8 Heat Pipes and Mirror-Finished Base (RR-UV8-XBU1-GP)", "price": 94.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j7%2Bwzp8GL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007SZ0EOW", "B007RIFKUS", "B006EWUO22", "B007SZ0E1K", "B000OGX5AM", "B0036Q7MV0", "B004RFBIUU", "B003S68Q0Y", "B0026ZPFCK", "B007SZ0EHE", "B002LE8BJA", "B009O7YUF6", "B005UBNLFK", "B0033Z2BAQ", "B004CRSM4I", "B004WK3KKQ", "B0046U6DTC", "B007KTY4A6", "B005E98EI2", "B002FRLEIS", "B002RWJGCM", "B0083Y6MV6", "B008KEPWMY", "B00966IREK", "B009NHAF06", "B007R21JK4", "B003PJ6QW4", "B004SUO068", "B008YDJHWM", "B004LB5AZY", "B001E0JH5E", "B0090Z39EA", "B0094NXBZ0", "B00A76E46I", "B002SRQ214", "B004MYFODI", "B0088PUEPK", "B0055QYKQO", "B005T3GRN2", "B00CO8TBQ0", "B0060SXDRI", "B007G51UV0", "B00906DHLE", "B003O8J12S", "B0068ZWZY0", "B0094NY3R0", "B0046Y1622", "B004Q0PT3I", "B007R21JJK", "B005E98FVS", "B00A4ZXE40", "B007YWMCA8", "B004QBUL1C", "B0026FCI2U", "B007G51UWY", "B004ZMG55I", "B007R1FH3K", "B002YIG9AQ", "B003PJ6QVU", "B009O7YU56", "B0035WTD2Q", "B002L16OMO", "B0090I9W66", "B007TG91WQ", "B008CJ1KAA", "B005T3GRLY", "B00603QXPM", "B007MKGF82", "B005X64OA8", "B0056KUWS4", "B004MYFODS", "B008G9V60K", "B004351H9G", "B001FVI91U", "B0046U6DWO", "B007TG8QRW", "B00752QYLK", "B005UBNKZG", "B004MYC6O8", "B0090I9VZI", "B004E0ZKLQ", "B009NB8WRU", "B008Y65MUA", "B003ZM7YTA", "B001EPUQAE", "B007KC1R3A", "B003O8J11E", "B0092ML0OC", "B007RARHSO", "B0055QYKQE", "B0061XSBZG", "B009NHAEXE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005O65JXI", "B000OGX5AM", "B00E0EXYDC", "B001NJ0D0Y"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "CPU Cooling Fans"]]}
