You can make and receive calls by using the keypad and Speakerphone in the base station. The phone's three-party conferencing lets you conduct business with three people conversing together on three different lines. Automatic line selection means that when the phone is ringing and you pick up, you will be connected to the one that is ringing. You can also set up different ringtones for each of the lines.A large display provides easy-to-read text for setup and caller information. The phone has a 100-entry memory and a 99-name-and-number caller ID history. Numbers stored in the caller ID history can be dialed directly; and with call waiting-capable caller ID, you can see who is calling even when you are already on the line. If you subscribe to a voicemail service, a red light blinks when you have voicemail waiting. For hands-free operation, the 2.5-millimeter jacks lets you connect a headset.", "title": "AT&amp;T 993 2-Line Phone w/Caller ID Charcoal", "price": 60.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41320IU4suL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "AT&amp;T", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007P8DKZ2", "B000ANOY7M", "B0032HM6JG", "B00007M1TZ", "B003HYU1WI", "B003EI0U0A", "B0012RZB0O", "B0032HM6HS", "B000067RC5", "B006L27EKK", "B005OD944Q", "B003BNY7QG", "B0042G7CBI", "B001PMI25M", "B005FVDXC6", "B001LQG28G", "B0006B088W", "B000LBXAKA", "B003BNY7PM", "B004BUVAS6", "B003YFHCKY", "B009R5VTX6", "B000LSTCOG", "B0002I7288", "B00009MVHF", "B0001V3AVY", "B003ELVLKU", "B000067RC1", "B002C42PSW", "B000SAF07K", "B0006ZIC1S", "B004UW0EMS", "B002TXG7OY", "B000UVRYAI", "B004QM99K0", "B004ZOUQHO", "B00009W3FR", "B006GQHRU8", "B00005BIEH", "B0019804U8", "B0084JMCF0", "B00BB5DJU6", "B004CX2VSU", "B00006JNNE", "B007B5VGFA"], "also_viewed": ["B007P8DKZ2", "B003BNY7QG", "B00009MVHF", "B002LBADIK", "B0000696Q1", "B00009MVHE", "B0012RZB0O", "B004YT7E16", "B00172K8CU", "B002L3XJ3Y", "B000LSTCOG", "B004KQDBKG", "B0012CJR2C", "B00960KQLS", "B003BNY7PM", "B0012CJR2W", "B009R5VTX6", "B005DJUVC0", "B007B5VGFA", "B007P7MXEW", "B002C42PSW", "B007P8DMBE", "B007B5VH0E", "B0007Q3QSK", "B000TBHLI4", "B004STS5NI", "B002D10C7K", "B0002ZAYZ4", "B0009AFVZK", "B005FVDWJA", "B004Q60O6E", "B001H6A39Y", "B000JLA3XE", "B002NLRDKY", "B005FVDXC6", "B001KNBQM2", "B001S2PKPE", "B005FVDXHQ", "B005FVDXE4", "B000UVT6AO", "B002L88902", "B001F04OIS", "B004IZN5X2", "B00183UHQU", "B000F8EVFM", "B000069LIG", "B000069LIH", "B000090WE9", "B001S2PKPO", "B000067V23", "B002B326BU", "B000UVRYAI", "B00005N5Y2", "B00000J3VQ", "B002L8A7NE"]}}
