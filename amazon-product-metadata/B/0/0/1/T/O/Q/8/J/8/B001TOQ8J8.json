With the help of Alice Murray, their mission coordinator, they now run their own paramilitary business, known as TransWorld Operations (TWO). Working what seems to be a routine mission in Shanghai they find themselves surrounded by a force of competing private military contractors intent on running amok in the city. Will Rios and Salem survive? Will they be able to make a few bucks off a bad situation? All they have is each other to rely on.GameplayAs with the originalArmy of Two, and as the name of the series implies, gameplay inArmy of Two: The 40th Dayrevolves around co-op combat tactics necessary to survive specific and general combat situations. Players can team up with an AI companion in single player mode or a human friend in two-player co-op. Co-op tactics are made aware to the player in what is known as the co-op playbook. Unlike the original game, which in some instances limited the use of some tactics to certain situations, inThe 40th Day, players have access to all tactics. Implementing these against opponents revolves around the game's \"Aggro\" system, tallied in the heads-up-display (HUD) and which measures the amount of attention a team member draws from opponents for certain tactics, leaving the other team member in various states of freedom to launch coordinated attacks as chosen. In addition to this change, players are also faced with moral dilemmas in the game, including choices presented to one of the players on a team that the other must bear the consequences of, as well as the decision as to deal with and/or defend civilian non-player characters (NPCs), who can be killed in the game.Multiplayer ModesIn addition to its single player campaign,Army of Two: The 40th Dayoffers a robust, region-free, multiplayer experience that provides an array of unique features for up to 12 players at a time. This experience consists of four modes, including, three brand-new modes that provide a variety of objectives for partners to battle over.
