In fact, IEEE1394 is the primary interface used for nearly all high-end professional audio and visual equipment.Plug-and-Play CapabilityAlthough the cable doesn't require a host computer to operate, giving it a distinct advantage over USB cables, it features plug-and-play functionality for those times when you wish to connect to your machine. This means that by connecting an IEEE 1394-enabled device to your computer, your operating system will auto-detect the device and ask for a driver disk. If the driver is already installed, your computer will immediately start \"talking\" to the device.IEEE 1394 devices are also hot-pluggable, which means that they can be connected and disconnected at any time--even with the device and computer powered on--without harming the device or compromising your data.Since 2003 many computers intended for home or professional audio/video use have built-in FireWire/i.LINK ports. Full support for IEEE 1394 is available for Microsoft Windows XP, Linux, Apple Mac OS 8.6 through Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X and greater.Manufactured for Performance and DurabilityThe AmazonBasics IEEE 1394 4-Pin/6-Pin FireWire Cable features gold-plated connectors for high-level conductivity and durability.
