It features full TTL support for digital SLR cameras. The bounce, zoom, and swivel head will give you more creative opportunities with your shots. The six position power zoom covers focal lengths of 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 70mm, and 85mm. It can be set to bounce at 0 Degree, 45 Degree, 60 Degree, 75 Degree, and 90 Degree, and has a horizontal swivel of 270 Degree to allow for softer lighting. The power level of the flash output can be set manually from full-power down to 1/16th. The flash includes a built-in slave function which allows it to be positioned off-camera, and triggered by any second flash. A red focus beam will help you achieve focus in low light conditions, and power saving circuitry incorporates an auto-off element, giving you more battery life. The incorporated flash reflecting plate creates beautiful lighting which greatly improves your images. The wide angle diffuser can be used to soften and increase the coverage of light from the flash. Red-eye reduction will prevent your flash from reflecting off your subject's eyes.", "title": "Vivitar DF383 Digital TTL Shoe Mount Power Zoom /Swivel /Bounce Auto-Focus Flash for Canon TTL, Guide Number 45m (147')", "price": 110.88, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514NakYIOIL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Vivitar", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017U0WM8", "B000OUA43E", "B005HTL15C", "B003M3A1BK", "B000BNY64C", "B0045DMA42", "B002ZIMEMW", "B0007U00X0", "B005IQRMN4", "B00007E7JU", "B003WD2SLQ", "B002W3IXZW", "B000UMX7FI", "B0034WR19Y", "B001WB02Z4", "B00ENSKUUK", "B007FH1KX2"], "bought_together": ["B0017U0WM8", "B002ZIMEMW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LEAYXY", "B00BXA7N6A", "B00E3K94T6", "B0017U0WM8"]}}
