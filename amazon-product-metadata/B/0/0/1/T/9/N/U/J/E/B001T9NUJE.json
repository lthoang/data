In other words, HDMI does not require manufacturers to implement everything that HDMI can do. HDMI provides a menu of capabilities and allows the manufacturer to choose which of those features make sense for its product line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you want the new video features called Deep Color, look for Deep Color in the feature set rather than HDMI 1.3, the version of the specification that enabled Deep Color. Why? Because the version of the specification that enables Deep Color (1.3) does not mandate that Deep Color functionality be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, HDMI strongly recommends that consumers look for products with the features they want, rather than the version number of the HDMI components.AmazonBasics HDMI cable (top) features dual-braided shielding to reduce interference and deliver a clean, crisp image vs, lower-quality cables (bottom).High-quality, gold-plated connectors resist corrosion while offering optimal signal transfer for superb audio and video quality.Compatible with 3D TV TechnologyAll current AmazonBasics HDMI cables support the latest HDMI compatible components and 3D TV functionality.
