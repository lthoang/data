While it is not electrically conductive  the compound is very slightly capacitive and could potentially cause problems if it bridges two close-proximity electrical paths.)Absolute Stability:Arctic Silver 5 will not separate  run  migrate  or bleed.Performance:3 to 12 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core.Coverage Area:The 12 gram tube contains enough compound to cover 50+ small CPU cores.Important Reminder:&nbsp;Due to the unique shape and sizes of the particles in Arctic Silver 5's conductive matrix  it will take a up to 200 hours and several thermal cycles to achieve maximum particle to particle thermal conduction and for the heatsink to CPU interface to reach maximum conductivity. (This period will be longer in a system without a fan on the heatsink or with a low speed fan on the heatsink.) On systems measuring actual internal core temperatures via the CPU's internal diode  the measured temperature will often drop 2C to 5C over this \"break-in\" period. This break-in will occur during the normal use of the computer as long as the computer is turned off from time to time and the interface is allowed to cool to room temperature. Once the break-in is complete  the computer can be left on if desired.", "title": "Arctic Silver 5 Large Size 12 gram tube", "price": 15.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31F4dh0X1jL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Arctic Silver 5", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TOR08", "B0087X71ZO", "B004Z9XG0I", "B0056QHJ8E", "B0087X738E", "B00DSUTWMQ", "B0087X7262", "B00C9TECFO", "B00FJRS6FU", "B0009IQ1BU", "B00C9TECUO", "B004230RUO", "B00KPRWAZQ", "B00II3BV54", "B001FVI91U", "B003TP2PU6", "B001O7ARUQ", "B00461G3MS", "B00JKCHDEU", "B004I12OYC", "B00KPRWAX8", "B0088PUEPK", "B000OGX5AM", "B002G1YPHA", "B004H5C0WK", "B00E3W1726", "B00DSUTX3O", "B003SX0ORA", "B009O7YUF6", "B00J2LIFBY", "B005J730WO", "B00B1R8JT0", "B004230RPY", "B00C9TEC0Y", "B00H3CPMUG", "B007N5YOU2", "B00EQ23OQA", "B0033Z2BAQ", "B0009B0K2I", "B007PPZ2I8", "B00F0RD3ZM", "B003TPQYV2", "B004ULZITS", "B008NWO9O0", "B008BTOBWA", "B00A1ZTZOG", "B00E0EXYDC", "B009GK4GEQ", "B002YIG9AQ", "B00B0FYHUI", "B0055U7REW", "B003TP8J4C", "B001KADQZU", "B00B0JN35Y", "B001NJ0D0Y", "B00F6S0XZI", "B00HEIFZQ0", "B009ZN2NH6", "B00CRIZTAE", "B0058FAYQ2", "B00B0OY8EY", "B007PPEW52", "B007B5YUMQ", "B007XKQXTC", "B00H09BOXQ", "B00DSUTVYK", "B00E3W15P0", "B005CT56R6", "B005OH8FUG", "B00GAXONJU", "B00BY12YIK", "B00GXNPJI6", "B00E3W19MO", "B004IZN3K2", "B00F3ZN0CC", "B009NB8WRU", "B003UUEDUU", "B00GDIIIPW", "B00KFAGCUM", "B00H09BB16", "B009OFSG94", "B00F3ZN2W0", "B005UWG9O4", "B00D5ZZZ70", "B004LZOO1Q", "B003NREDC8", "B005T3GRNW", "B004QEJUXO", "B005LIDU5S", "B000ODOKV8", "B001R4BT1M", "B00HFEBS8W", "B0097LG9U8", "B00903F1AM", "B00GIZ3APS", "B00EUAFAF6", "B00K2MASE4", "B000BQPX8W", "B005C6H26C", "B0050MR8CG"], "bought_together": ["B0007TOR08", "B000OGX5AM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OGX5AM", "B0087X71ZO", "B001FVI91U", "B004Z9XG0I"]}}
