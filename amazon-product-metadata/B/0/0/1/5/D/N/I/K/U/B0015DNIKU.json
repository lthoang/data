This sleek, slim head-turner is the perfect everyday camera. High-end specifications include 10.0-megapixel resolution and a 3x optical zoom lens. Spectacular images are easy to create thanks to advanced Canon technologies like Face Detection and Motion Detection Technologies that eliminate blur.PowerShot SD770IS Highlights1x zoom/3x zoom3x optical zoom and Optical Image StabilizerThe PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH&#x92;s 3x optical zoom is a clear winner when it comes to getting up close and personal. And Canon&#x92;s invaluable Optical Image Stabilizer reduces the blur of camera movement, even in tricky low light situations.2.5-inch PureColor LCD II screen for bright, accurate colorThe PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon&#x92;s PureColor LCD II offers more spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle (compared to PureColor LCD). The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light -- a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images.Motion Detection Technology automatically detects subject movement and optimizes exposure controlLife doesn&#x92;t stand still for picture-taking. That&#x92;s why Canon included its advanced Motion Detection Technology in the PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH. This sophisticated feature works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. Then it automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. When you need higher ISOs for action-stopping shutter speeds, Motion Detection Technology provides it. But when no movement is detected, it allows lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. So whether you&#x92;re shooting a bride walking down the aisle, a ballet recital or even a child&#x92;s soccer game, you can relax and shoot with confidence knowing you&#x92;ve got the picture you intended.With Canon's Face Detection WB (right), skin tones are not affected by overall lightingImproved Face Detection Technology sets the focus, exposure, flash and white balance automaticallyCanon's powerful Face Detection Technology delivers even better results with the new SD770 IS Digital ELPH. The Face Detection Technology continues to recognize faces in a scene, and concentrate exposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon them. But the SD770 IS Digital ELPH adds more: Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the SD770 IS Digital ELPH user highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection Technology.DIGIC III Image Processor for superior image quality and improved functionalityWith DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What&#x92;s more, DIGIC III enables Canon&#x92;s Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the SD770 IS Digital ELPH's menu.iSAPS Technologyis an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.Red-eye Correctionprovides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.1) The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.2) The SD770 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.3) The user can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them.Print/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloadingThe PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD770 IS Digital ELPH to a Canon PIXMA photo printer or SELPHY compact photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh).Print your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY compact photo printer."}
