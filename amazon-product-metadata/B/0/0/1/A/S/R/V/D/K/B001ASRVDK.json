It  holds up to 650 pounds, but weighs only 26. Easily portable, it carries  upto three people and gear, but can be transported and used by one adult  alone. You can even bring your dog out on the water--the rugged  PolyKrylar hull is tough enough to withstand dog paws and claws. The  SE370 packs down to fit in a storage bag, but has cargo space for  camping gear and other supplies. It can be used for paddling, fishing,  yacht tending, or skin diving. You can even take it on the river as it  can handle whitewater up to class III.The Sea Eagle  features an extra thick 38-millimeter Polykrylar hull, an I-beam  construction floor for extra rigidity, inflatable spray skirts,  removable inflatable front and rear seat, front and rear rope handles,  and a self-bailing drain valve (a handy feature on whitewater rivers or  in ocean surf). It also features two molded kegs for tracking and speed  to track smoothly across the water, and high-freqency welded seams that  fuse the material into one solid piece.The PolyKrylar hull is strong enough to withstand dog paws and claws.Features:Lightweight and portable inflatable sport kayakNMMA CertifiedSelf-bailing drain valve3 deluxe one-way valvesLashed-down inflatable spray skirtsI-beam construction floor2 skegs on the bottom for better tracking and speedPressure gauge and repair kitBow &amp; stern grab lineRugged PolyKrylar hull is tough enough to withstand dog pawsSpecifications:Interior: 10 feet, 8 inches by 1 foot, 1 inchExterior: 12 feet, 6 inches by 2 feet, 10inchesDeflated: 31 by 19 by 8 inchesTube Diameter: 9 inchesCapacity: 3 Persons or 650 poundsWeight: 32 poundsChambers: 3 (port, starboard,floor)Material: 38 mil PolyKrylar (K80 PVC)Seam: High-frequency weldedFloor: Inflatable I-beam constructionAir Valves: 5 deluxe one-wayInflation &amp; Assembly time:  8 minutes"}
