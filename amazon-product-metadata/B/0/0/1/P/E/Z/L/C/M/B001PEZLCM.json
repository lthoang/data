The Mader family has been involved in agriculture for five generations. Our farm operations span across the south east part of Washington State and are headquartered in Pullman, WA. In 2001 we acted on an opportunity to add a grain and legume cleaning facility to our operation. Our Cleaning Facility, Palouse Trading is located in Palouse, WA - just a short drive from Pullman. Palouse Trading was originally named Wallace Grain and Pea when it first opened its doors in the 1930's. The plant was designed for quality not quantity and has cleaned legumes and grains for the international market and domestic consumption. Our food is appealing to our consumers because of its nutrition, aesthetics and traceability to our farm. Each bag of food comes with a QR Code that allows you to see harvest details of your food, seeding dates, the field we grew it in, and more. All of our products are certified Kosher Parve, Non-GMO Project Certified and our farming methods are Certified Sustainable by the Food Alliance. Our foods are different because Steve & Kevin Mader plant, harvest, clean and package at our own facilities in Washington State - there are few if any companies that can track your food and details of your food back to the field like we do.", "title": "Non-GMO Project Verified Hard Red Spring Wheat Berries | 100% Non-Irradiated | Certified Kosher Parve | USA Grown |Identity Preserved (We tell you which field we grew it in)", "price": 11.95, "salesRank": {"Grocery & Gourmet Food": 6793}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eyDzXjfUL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005XDUA9K", "B00A6TKLRC", "B004R6DHE4", "B001PF1846", "B000U5NZ4I", "B0018P54TS", "B001PEZLCW", "B000CPJKWC", "B004VLVOK4", "B006P2KG0Q", "B008EXFCM6", "B001PEWJWC", "B004VLSWFY", "B001UI37N8", "B0071GWMA2", "B00BYBN4WU", "B004VLVOJ0", "B00656RJDY", "1592336000", "B0049YK2CO", "B006M6I5UI", "B002LLOKBG", "B00881WOQ6", "B006M4PQWU", "B005FVPP04", "B000E7MTUI", "B00015UEMI", "B007SM6NWW", "B00A2K12LO", "B00H5IOYW0", "B0045VV928", "B003DVP1V6", "B003LPKEMU", "B0049YK20Q", "B002V5MBM2", "B00004SGFL", "B0026S3K42", "B004VLVGK2", "B000RHXKTO", "B0052MWL7Q", "B000E7OYMY", "0812969677", "B0002LY8PA", "B00028Q450", "B00A13IVGG", "B001197UIO", "B00CMXCYZW", "B005CD3ADE", "B0006ZN52E", "B002OCIGZI", "061525330X", "B007KAY4S2", "B000EDBPZC", "B0097FMQVK", "B001949USO", "B0018KJHY6", "B004ZPK7KY", "B005CD3J6C", "B000EDK5LM", "B0001W2W58", "B00BN9GEKC", "B000E7OYVU", "B001EO7FTU", "B005LRBGEQ", "B002C0E5VG", "160342153X", "B003HRQVB0", "B0052OP1HG", "B000JMAXMY", "B004VLVJP4", "B00BJ6STDY", "B002NEDJ3G", "B0049YP724", "B00JLG0UUO", "B0096R5CJC", "B000K89490", "B0007MTMH8", "B007HUNITQ", "B00HZ9ZYL4", "B00CLVT3XQ", "B000FA3TIA", "B0052OP2CU", "B008N05H4I", "B004X8W2AG", "B000WRZODY", "0895292343", "B005LRAFQ6", "B0021WVKV8", "B004VLVB5C", "B0049YK1FC", "B00480GXXG", "B00FTBQ0RW", "B003WHLVYC", "B004FRZ7PC", "B000QFSAJW", "B0016KU16G", "0895291959"], "also_viewed": ["B005XDUA9K", "B0049YK20Q", "B00A6TKLRC", "B00656RJDY", "B00HGV0EUM", "B00D36EB1C", "B005CD39I0", "B00115RPFQ", "B004X8W256", "B003YPYRCU", "B0052OMMWI", "B004X8W2AG", "B001PF1846", "B00A2K12LO", "B000RHVKG4", "B000E7QYNG", "B00DB8KSVO", "B004R6DHE4", "B00CMXCYZW", "B002KMRR7K", "B001PEZLCW", "B004VLVOK4", "B003WI7QW2", "B0049YK2CO", "B00015YTVA", "B000U5NZ4I", "B000CPJKWC", "B006P2KG0Q", "B0018P54TS", "B000E7L2T2", "B0049YRBWI", "B006M6I5UI", "B001PEWJWC", "B000E7OYVA", "B001UI37N8", "B00015UEMI", "B00CVH4RFY", "B002V5MBM2", "B004VLSWFY", "B000E7L2S8", "B000RHVIQG", "B00JU4TOM2", "B006M4PQWU", "B0071GWMA2", "B0018KJHY6", "B003DVP1V6", "B0052OMSMC", "B004VLVGK2", "B0049YK1FC", "B000E7QYO0", "B002NEDJ3G", "B0049YP724", "B000RHXKTO", "B005CD3J6C", "B0026S3K42", "B003WHLVYC", "B00BYBN4WU"], "bought_together": ["B005XDUA9K", "B00A6TKLRC"]}}
