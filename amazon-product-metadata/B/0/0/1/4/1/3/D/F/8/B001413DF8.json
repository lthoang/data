Instead, the TV intelligently calculates the &lsquo;middle&rsquo; image between frame A and frame B and inserts it in between (Auto Motion Plus 120Hz processor), making a fluid transition from one frame to the next.Super Clear PanelSamsung enhances the clarity of select LCD HDTVs by replacing the light-diffusing plastic face of traditional LCD HDTVs with a&nbsp; natural black panel with a clear anti-glare shield. Reduced reflection of external light creates a new dimension in image clarity, highlighting black and darkened areas, enabling vibrant, more compelling colors and a brighter, clearer picture.&nbsp; Black will never again appear grayish. Black details will show in vivid black even in dark scenes.The latest version of Samsung&rsquo;s breakthrough super clear panel technology makes colors appear more vibrant and blacks even deeper than ever. Enhanced films reduce glare and optimize off-angle viewing.50,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio/500 nit Brightness50,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio will give you a picture better than you ever thought possible, with whiter whites, blacker blacks and a nearly infinite subtlety of gradations in between.

This exclusive Samsung technology dramatically improves the picture by enhancing the contrast, detail, white balance and reduces.Wide Color Enhancer/Cold Cathode Flourescent LampThe NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) has established the color standards all TVs in America try to meet. And typical LCD TVs only meet about 72% of this standard. Samsung LCD HDTVs use Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp backlights to give you 92% coverage of the NTSC standard, ensuring truer, more breathlessly vivid colors.Samsung&rsquo;s exclusive Wide Color Enhancer technology delivers more brilliant colors, even in bright areas of the picture where blues and greens are washed out on conventional screens. The system displays wider color reproduction, showing you truer colors &ndash; the fresh green of spring foliage, the intense blue of the summer sky.ConnectivityTo make the Series 6 a true entertainment hub for any home, Samsung has incorporated advanced HD connectivity and networking capabilities that expand the HDTV&rsquo;s functionality. A wide variety of multimedia devices can be connected to the set through any one of the four Simplay compliant HDMI 1.3 inputs (including one on the side), and the handy HDMICEC feature lets you control all your CEC-enabled peripherals using just one remote.Connect HD digital devices like disc players, game consoles, and satellite dish components into the 2 rear connections and use the side-mounted input for cameras, camcorders, and laptops. HDMI is the best performing interface for displaying an HD source on an HDTV.Once connected, users can easily access device menus and manage and display content through the newly redesigned Wheel Key Remote control and the HDTV&rsquo;s sophisticated content management interface.All ConnectionsHDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface version 1.3): 4 (3 rear/1 side)Ethernet portComponent video: 2 (Y, Pb, Pr)S-Video input: 1 side/1 rearA/V inputs: 1 side/1 rearPC Inpuy (D-Sub): 1RF antenna inputs: 2HDMI-CECPremium audio: Improved sound quality with dedicated low-range speaker systemHeadphone jackSuper Patterned Vertical AlignmentSamsung&rsquo;s Super Patterned Vertical Alignment (SPVA) panel provides a 178-degree viewing angle from all four axesAudio FeaturesTruSurround is a patented SRS technology that solves the problem of playing 5.1 multichannel content over two speakers. TruSurround delivers a compelling, virtual surround sound experience through any two-speaker playback system, including internal television speakers and headphones. It is fully compatible with all multichannel formats up to 5.1 channels. High-quality virtual surround sound can be experienced with just the two hidden, downward-firing side-mounted 2.2-channel dome speakers built into the TV.SRS TruSurround XT technology delivers an amazing, simulated 3D effect with clear dialog and powerful bass.TruSurround XT audio also adds three audio enhancement technologies to produce an amazingly immersive sound experience.Dialog Clarity brings movie dialog into Focus during the playback of any surround-encoded material to make speech much clearer and crisper.TruBass creates incredible deep rich bass allowing a person to perceive significantly deeper, richer low bass tones that are far beyond the physical low frequency capabilities of the speaker itself.The SRS WOW feature widens the soundstage by processing standard two-channel stereo material as well as multi-channel encoded material for a dramatic improvement in the playback of any stereo audio over a two-speaker system.Stereo broadcast reception is offered for MTS and SAP with 181-channel capacity. A sound leveler keeps audio volume consistent during channel changing.Which Size HDTV is Right for My Room?With standard-definition TVs, the rule used to be that viewers would feel comfortable watching a set from a distance of 3 to 6 times the screen size in inches. With HDTV, the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.If you know the size of the room you have already, where you want to sit, and where your new HDTV should go once you get it, you can figure out the size HDTV you should get.Minimum size = Viewing distance/3Maximum size=Viewing distance/1.5Which Samsung LCD HDTV is Right for You?Series 3Look at Series 3 LCD HDTVs19- and 22-inch Models3,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio8 ms response timeHDMI 1.3 port: Simplay compliantPC Input port2 Hidden 3-watt speakers with SRS TruSurround XT audioWide Color Enhancer technology and Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) offer a wider color rangeV-Chip system allows blocking of rated TV and movie programs determined by the parent to contain objectionable content.Trilingual on-screen displays in English, Spanish or French.Variable sleep timer to turn the TV off in varying time intervals.Auto wall mount compatible: 3-dimensional operation via TV&rsquo;s remote control;
