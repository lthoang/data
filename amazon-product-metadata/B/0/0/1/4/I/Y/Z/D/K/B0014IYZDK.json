First, there's the Wireless Access Point, which lets you connect to the network without wires. There's also a built-in 4-port full-duplex 10/100 switch to connect your wired-Ethernet devices together. Finally, the router function ties it all together and lets your whole network share a high-speed cable or DSL Internet connection.The access point built into the router uses smart antenna technology to achieve extended range.  Unlike ordinary wireless networking technologies that are confused by signal reflections, the \"Multiple In, Multiple Out\" (MIMO) technology actually uses these reflections to increase the range and reduce \"dead spots\" in the wireless coverage area. The robust signal travels farther, maintaining wireless connections much farther than standard Wireless-G.  With MIMO, the farther away you are, the more speed advantage you get. It works great with standard Wireless-G and -B equipment, but when both ends of the wireless link are MIMO enabled, the router can increase the throughput even more by using twice as much radio band. But unlike other speed-enhanced technologies, the RangePlus Wireless Router can dynamically enable this double-speed mode for compatible devices, while still connecting to other wireless devices at their respective fastest speeds. In congested areas, the \"good neighbor\" mode ensures that the router checks for other wireless devices in the area before gobbling up the radio band.To help protect your data and privacy, the router can encode all wireless transmissions with industrial-strength 256-bit encryption. It can serve as your network's DHCP server, has a powerful SPI firewall to protect your PCs against intruders and most known Internet attacks, and supports VPN pass-through. Configuration is a snap with the web browser-based configuration utility.With the Linksys RangePlus Wireless Router at the center of your home or office network, you can share a high-speed Internet connection, files, printers, and multi-player games, and run media-intensive applications at incredible speeds, without the hassle of stringing wires!Features include:Internet-sharing router and 4-port switch with a built in speed and range enhanced Wireless access pointMIMO smart antenna technology captures faint signals for extended range and reduced dead spotsMuch faster than Wireless-G when connected to Wireless-N, but also works great with Wireless-G and -B devicesWireless signals protected by wireless encryptionYour network protected is from Internet attacks by a powerful SPI firewall", "title": "Cisco-Linksys WRT110 RangePlus Wireless Router", "price": 37.8, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 53637}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41d7CCq-E-L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004T9RR6I", "B004T9RR4A", "B0028N6VNW", "B001BU3K0A", "B000Z3U1P6", "B000Z3XXR4", "B0014J07R2", "B007IL6OR2", "B007IL764W", "B007IL7AKM", "B007IL72CI", "B00005ARK3", "B003B20F54", "B00007KDVI", "B000BTL0OA", "B0001D3K8A", "B001AZ01EO", "B003NM81U8", "B00AAU54TW", "B001SEL36M", "B001UI4RTG", "B003B4AVRE", "B003B48UNG", "B00D8BQI5O", "B00008SCFL", "B000WG3ZU4", "B0041LYY6K", "B001AZP8EW", "B00C0WZ9FW", "B006C2DV5G", "B0077BB3VA", "B006QB1RPY", "B003B48UQ8", "B001SEL326", "B006UACRVO", "B003B4AVSS", "B008I21EA2", "B001FWYGJS", "B00DLYD31A", "B004T9RR7C", "B003VYEYE0", "B005S0BYQ6", "B007M8SGW2", "B0087NZ31S", "B0049YQVHE", "B004N625AK", "B00KGW1RIQ", "B00HU7C7Q6", "B003Y5RYNY", "B004N625AA", "B008HO9DK4", "B001954DPI", "B0088EKH08", "B0062KA4VM", "B005FDXMJS", "B009MN18FC", "B000LIFB7S", "B000MANHJE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004T9RR6I", "B00A3YN0Z0", "B006QB1RPY", "B004T9RR4A"]}}
