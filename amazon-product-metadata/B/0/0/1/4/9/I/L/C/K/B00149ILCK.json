Although living in occupied WWII Paris, Sean is initially concerned only with the racing lifestyle and his friends within it. That all changes though when the Nazis kill his friends, and change his life forever. Seeking personal retribution on a Nazi officer and others involved, Sean's life soon becomes dominated by a need for payback, which is exacted with the help of the French Resistance, British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, and your own street smarts and brawn. Motivated by retribution and armed with tactics of sabotage you are a one man wrecking crew, blowing up zeppelins, derailing trains, imploding bridges, destroying armored tanks, and leveling enemy facilities in the name of vengeance.Open-world GameplayThe Saboteurin the first open-world, action game set in Nazi-occupied Europe, and combines a variety of different kinds of gameplay, including third-person shooter, stealth and racing. As in other open-world games, this means that although players will be tasked with completing an extensive list of set missions against Nazi units and individuals, they will also have the freedom to explore and fight throughout the game world as they choose. This world although set in Paris also encompasses the French countryside, as well as parts of Germany. Within it players will be able to use representations of actual landmarks &#151; for example, the Eiffel Tower &#151; for navigation, and a variety of vehicles for transportation and combat. In mission play, with each success players move closer to tracking down the particular Nazis responsible for the death of Sean's friends by putting the rewards that they receive for success to work on the black-market. They can trade for all sorts of items to help their progress, from weapons, to cars, maps and more. These all can also either be found throughout the game, or taken from defeated opponents, although the more commotion that is created and the higher the skills of the player, the greater the enemy response will be.The \"Will to Fight\" SystemAlthough built around Sean's desire for personal revenge,The Saboteuralso contains a play mechanism through which the lives of the non-player characters (NPCs) are improved, and can even be manipulated.
