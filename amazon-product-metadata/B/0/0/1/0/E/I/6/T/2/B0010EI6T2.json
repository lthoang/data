Equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, Team Rainbow is deployed during terrorist crises. When all other attempts have failed, Rainbow is brought in to save the lives of  innocent people. They do not negotiate with terror. They destroy it.Rainbow began as an idea shared by John Clark and Domingo \"Ding\" Chavez. Clark, a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative, met Chavez during a covert  operation in Colombia. During the operation, Chavez was rescued by Clark. After that mission, Chavez joined the Central Intelligence Agency. Clark and Chavez developed a mentor-student relationship over the course of several missions together.Rainbow was created in 2000. Ding Chavez was made a Team Leader and began recruiting counter-terrorism operatives immediately. Experts in  close-quarters combat, demolitions, electronics, surveillances, and  reconnaissance were recruited. Snipers, hackers, soldiers, policemen, and contractors were all brought to Hereford, England, where Rainbow shares its headquarters with the British Special Air Service.", "price": 19.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/612P2BaUvjL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HGOHWO", "B000M4KJ32", "B0037LVW9M", "B00CWYYLH0", "B001TOMQOY", "B000M5KT5Y", "B000RHZ9G6", "B0086V5V8G", "B000WS97QI", "B0050SXEM8", "B002ZJNWWC", "B002I0J82G", "B00109KMQ2", "B0023CBZ70", "B0050SWZHS", "B00163LW7K", "B00320JAWY", "B000PS4X9G", "B000N4MSAS", "B004HCYVO8", "B003Q55YCU", "B002I0K6DG", "B00503E9FY", "B003GT8IL0", "B0050SXOD2", "B002ELCV00", "B001AWDFUY", "B003O6E67A", "B00269QLH4", "B004EW948E", "B005GM3XVA", "B001C4DKG4", "B004EDJOYC", "B003H0CBYS", "B0022TNO7I", "B002I0H2G0", "B0016B28WU", "B001QXNBNI", "B00G9DFMDW", "B001NX6GBK", "B000UUATJ2", "B001OAKV4K", "B003VWGBBG", "B002BRZ744", "B000V1OUVI", "B0012NAPNQ", "B000FQ2D5E", "B0012N3T3Y", "B000TG72TM", "B00198PO5I", "B0076ZQSFI", "B002BRZ6UE", "B000FPOJOS", "B003O6ECOM", "B0012N94WO", "B003P9FRGA", "B005185SDA", "B003JVCA9Q", "B00G6MW4SM", "B000NGP1R8", "B00576U7W8", "B000FQBF1M", "B002I0K5NC", "B0050SXLQC", "B00309XHD0", "B0050SX9VO", "B0050SXGU8", "B001AWBYNE", "B001RTCOWA", "B002I0J5UQ", "B001NIP3EG", "B000GPXSCQ", "B000QAVV6G", "B001SGZL2W", "B002Z7BE24", "B003O6CBIG", "B004UDB9SA", "B0036FDHT2", "B004PFN52G", "B007XVTR5S", "B003VKLAAU", "B004CVQUOI", "B0050SXZ7W", "B002DC8GKO", "B00BMFIXKQ", "B00354NANC", "B002I0J8FI", "B005THAX6K", "B0050SXFKE", "B0050SXX88", "B000KLNLUK", "B0017XFP8G", "B002I0J5YW", "B0085CA8QG", "B003S2MXQG", "B000R3CIV4", "B001TOMQSK", "B000WMEEBM", "B008E6ZXTA", "B000X1TC0U"], "bought_together": ["B000HGOHWO", "B000M4KJ32"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HGOHWO", "B0037LVW9M", "B0086V5V8G", "B00CWYYLH0"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5245}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PlayStation 3"]]}
