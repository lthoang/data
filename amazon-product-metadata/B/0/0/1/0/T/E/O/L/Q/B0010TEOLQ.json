The Game Adapter can be used in several different ways. If you have an existing home wireless network and a cable or DSL Internet connection, the Game Adapter lets your Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation2 or 3, or GameCube attach to the network so you can get into online games without running wires to the game room. Or, use a pair of Game Adapters to form a \"cable-less cable\" between two game consoles for head-to-head gaming -- in the same room, or all the way across the house. There is also a special \"Wireless LAN Party\" mode to connect several consoles at once.", "title": "Cisco-Linksys WGA600N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming Adapter", "price": 78.8, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 48938}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4180m3HQT7L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0056VP0KS", "B001QVQ7JU", "B005RCZEIY", "B00009X6DT", "B0024G48VA", "B00020H1TG", "B00005QBX9", "B008LTPFG6", "B00FX38A56", "B005N6XBDO", "B003KPBRRW", "B004ZEZC0U", "B000BTL0OA", "B002RS7NB2", "B008K24BKU", "B0062K5JAI", "B0090DX8O8", "B007CO5DZ4", "B004UAKCS6", "B004FMI3DA", "B000B6MLV4", "B004BAN3D6", "B00A66WJWK", "B00E37JJCQ", "B0001D3K8A", "B005OIB6XI", "B003D3OOYY", "B004LA8BVU", "B00333AWTA", "B004T9RR4A", "B007IL6OR2", "B001AGM2VI", "B00416Q5KI", "B005O88CY4", "B0002MH3HE", "B006P191F8", "B004GL2Q4C", "B00D8BQI5O", "B00BXKY9CQ", "B004T9RR7C", "B00IJYGICI", "B001769K3O", "B00134LUE2", "B007KZQM9G", "B008CV8ST4", "B000Z7AKGC", "B008RV51EE", "B0054YQO5C", "B005S0BYQ6", "B001UI4RTG", "B001Z5140O", "B006CQR7CK", "B009RRZ36I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0056VP0KS", "B005RCZEIY", "B001QVQ7JU", "B000BTL0OA"]}}
