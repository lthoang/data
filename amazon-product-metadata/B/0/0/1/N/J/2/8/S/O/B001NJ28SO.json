It is two years after Judgment Day--the date that the Terminator mythology assigns to the nuclear event that the machines will rain down on planet Earth--and what's left of humanity is caught in a life and death struggle against that same machine intelligence that sprung to life from the former defense super computer known as Skynet. Yet things are not quite what the the earlier chapters in the Terminator saga had predicted for these days. Although over the last two years human survivors of the catastrophe have prepared and organized themselves for the ongoing battle with the machines, John Connor, the character that the player assumes, has yet to emerge as the legendary hero he was foretold to be, and time is running out. In its early nuclear strikes against humanity, Skynet damaged part of itself. It has spent the last two years rebuilding its strength as well in order to complete its mission of the extermination of the human race. Now is the time to strike back at the machines. Now is the time for you and John Connor to take command.Gameplay and Co-op SupportAction inTerminator: Salvationis from a third-person perspective and relies heavily on the use of cover. Correspondingly players will be able to lock on to cover, dive or slide from one cover point to the next and fire weapons without exposing themselves to return fire, but this doesn't mean that combat is easy. Cover is fully destructible in the game, meaning that your mechanical enemies will attempt to take that advantage away from you if they recognize that you are dug in. They will also make every attempt to flank your position. These two points are important becauseTerminator: Salvationforces you to take care of yourself in its single player campaign by not featuring a health regeneration system between checkpoints (health is fully restored at the end of survived levels). But health can be regenerated during combat via an AI or human teammate anytime when playing in the game's local co-op mode. The ability to team up in co-op mode is also a major aspect of gameplay in that it allows players to turn the tables on terminator units by flanking them and attacking their less heavily armored sides rather than head on. Both single player and co-op modes also feature access to vehicles which can be battled from as well.Key FeaturesTerminator Mythology- Set two years prior to the upcoming Terminator Salvation film, play as John Connor for the first time and continue the epic fiction of the Terminator mythology.Intelligent Robotic Enemies- Unrelenting and incredibly resilient iconic enemies from the Terminator franchise fight to the bitter end on land and in the sky.Destructible Cover Gameplay- Advanced cover mechanics allows you to use the destructible environment as protection and strategically navigate through enemy entrenched territory.
