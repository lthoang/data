The lens is equipped with an exclusive Silent Wave Motor (SWM) that enables accurate, quiet, high-speed autofocus operation. The lens's pair of aspherical elements, meanwhile, virtually eliminate coma and other types of aberration even at the widest aperture. Add in an extra-low-dispersion (ED) glass element--which effectively minimizes chromatic aberration--and your photos will enjoy superior sharpness and color correction regardless of the subject. Other details include an internal focusing (IF) design that enables the use of polarizers and speed-light systems; a Nano Crystal Coat that virtually eliminates reflections across a wide range of wavelengths for even greater image integrity; a Super Integrated Coating (SIC) that substantially reduces ghosting and flare; a rounded nine-blade diaphragm that makes out-of-focus image elements appear more natural; and a M/A focus mode that allows you to quickly transition between autofocus and manual operation.SpecificationsFocal length: 60mmMaximum aperture: f/2.8Minimum aperture: f/32Autofocus: YesSilent Wave Motor (SWM): YesCompatible formats: FX, DX, FX in DX crop mode, 35mm filmVibration reduction: NoDistance information: YesED glass elements: YesSuper Integrated Coating: YesNano Crystal Coat: YesInternal focusing: YesRear focusing: NoDe-focus control: NoClose-range correction: NoManual/auto focus mode: YesMinimum focusing distance: 0.6 feetAngle of view: 39 degrees @ 40 feetLens construction: 12 elements in 9 groupsED elements: 1Maximum reproduction ratio: 1xFilter type: 62mm screw-onMount type: Nikon F-bayonetLens case: CL-1018Lens hood: HB-42Dimensions: 2.9 inches in diameter and 3.5 inches longWeight: 15 ouncesWarranty: 1 year"}
