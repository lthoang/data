The lens is equipped with Nikon's Vibration Reduction technology, which minimizes the effects of camera shake. This allows handheld shooting at up to four shutter speeds slower than would otherwise be possible, producing dramatically sharper images at distance. The lens also offers two extra-low-dispersion (ED) glass elements, which minimize chromatic aberration to produce superior sharpness and color correction, and three aspherical lens elements, which virtually eliminate coma effects and other flaws, even when used at the widest aperture. And photojournalists will love the exclusive Nikon Silent Wave Motor (SWM), which facilitates accurate, high-speed, ultra-quiet autofocusing.Other features include a Super Integrated Coating (SIC) that offers superior color performance and reduced ghosting and flare; a closest focusing distance of 1.3 feet throughout the entire zoom range; a rounded seven-blade diaphragm that improves the appearance of out-of-focus image elements; and a one-year warranty.SpecificationsFocal length: 16 to 85mmMaximum aperture: f/3.5 to f/5.6Zoom ratio: 5.3xMinimum aperture: f/22 to f/36AF-S Silent Wave Motor: YesVibration Reduction: YesMinimum focus distance: 1.3 feetMaximum angle of view: 83 degreesDimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter and 3.4 inches longWeight: 17.1 ouncesWarranty: 1 year"}
