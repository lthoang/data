This problem can be easily solved by using our USB 2.0 \"\"Y\"\" Cables. Simply plug this cable's USB Mini-B end into the device and the two USB A ends into open USB ports on a single PC or Mac. The cable then pulls power from both USB ports, increasing the output to the external drive. The cable features a red molded hood for the auxiliary USB A connector, allowing the user to easily distinguish between main and auxiliary power. Foil and braid shielding reduces EMI/RFI interference and a twisted-pair construction helps reduce crosstalk, ensuring high-speed, error-free data transfer. This cable is compatible with USB 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 specifications.", "title": "C2G / Cables to Go 28107 USB 2.0 Mini-B Male to 2 USB A Male Y-Cable (6 Feet, Black)", "price": 7.85, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31DVGTF-8gL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "C2G", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003HHK576", "B0047AALS0", "B008PQA3JO", "B005M0ICG2", "B0047AALW6", "B003WV5DMO", "B002GWMLE8", "B00KFAGD88", "B005SEZR0G", "B002N2EL6C", "B0013LSFJI", "B000BSN4UY", "B004JJTIEW", "B000JIOHDE", "B0041CFFBM", "B00474R7HO", "B003HHK58U", "B002W8EDOM", "B00439567Q", "B004FNS7DA", "B00AJHCRCI", "B00CXAC1ZW", "B00BCY1AA2", "B009YPYORM", "B001E1Y5O6", "B001TH7GUK", "B00AO1XFM0", "B001VLIL3K", "B001TH7GUU", "B002YKPX6U", "B001MSU1FS", "B003Z4G3I6", "B003SNJRA0", "B003VQR1TS", "B007NLW3C2", "B00009YFTI", "B00AXCRJV8", "B003M0NURK", "B008EQZ25K", "B00EI94JWY", "B0002V85MW", "B000BSJFFC", "B000XPS3U6", "B0023FTRUO", "B000BSJFO8", "B00484IEJS", "B003ES5ZSW", "B005HKIDF2", "B0056EW4A4", "B000VRL632", "B00C7SRHDG", "B0002861MG", "B001TH7GUA", "B001TH7GV4", "B00DBV28TG", "B00B46XUQU", "B00C28L6XI", "B003SX0ORA", "B009D79VH4", "B003M0NT1M", "B005GGBYJ4", "B004GF8TIK", "B000067RC4"], "bought_together": ["B003HHK576", "B005M0ICG2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003HHK576", "B003WV5DMO", "B005M0ICG2", "B0047AALS0"]}}
