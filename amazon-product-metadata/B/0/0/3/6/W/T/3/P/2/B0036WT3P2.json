With HDTV, the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.If you know the size of the room you have already, where you want to sit, and where your new HDTV should go once you get it, you can figure out the size HDTV you should get.Minimum size = Viewing distance/3Maximum size=Viewing distance/1.5", "title": "Samsung LN40C630 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black)", "price": 16.75, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 41616}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xJo8uhY-L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00BD8SZLE", "B0073WAK8K", "B00K4UJ2Q4", "B0036WT492", "B00BB9ORUS", "B00I94ISS0", "B00CALLZK6", "B008KECFRO", "B00723QKVQ", "B0083KGX96", "B0036WT4C4", "B00BD8TMIO", "B00K4UIODQ", "B00BCGRXI8", "B0074FGR74", "B00BB9ORT4", "B0071O4EKU", "B00I0S70J8", "B009IBXECS", "B00BN3W19Q", "B00HPMCO46", "B00BB0ZTO0", "B00CI3BIT4", "B00CI3BP06", "B00IDXB1W2", "B00I3WQPE2", "B00II6VT0S", "B00I94IRC2", "B00BB0ZTJA", "B00JJNA10I", "B00I0S70GQ", "B00GKKI4Q6", "B004NP1E9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003LR5HRK", "B0074FGR74", "B001GTT0VO", "B00BD8SZLE", "B00BD8SZLE"]}}
