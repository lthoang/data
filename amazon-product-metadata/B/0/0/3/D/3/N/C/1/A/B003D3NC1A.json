Just like a Bodum teapot, it allows free-swirling tea leaves to release their full potential, but on a smaller, individual scale! The finely woven plastic filter ensures that leaves and kernels remain within the strainer while brewing, allowing the aroma of the tea to fully evolve without the messy remains of tea leaves escaping into the cup. The multi-functional silicone lid helps to keep the water warm while the tea is brewing and after brewing, use it as a saucer for the tea infuser. Available in Black, Orange, Red, and Green."}
