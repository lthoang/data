Modern lenses often have UV protection built into them as well as digital sensors, however, UV filters are commonly used to help protect the surface of the lens from scratches, smudges, dirt and other hazards.Circular Polarizing Filters:A polarizer is different than most filters in that it is composed of two pieces of glass, mounted independently inside a round frame so that one can be rotated relative to the other. As it is rotated, it increasingly cuts out glare and haze. With an SLR, you can actually observe this change through the viewfinder. Polarizers reduce glare from water, glass, or any non-metallic surface. You can also use a polarizer filter to darken blue skies.FLD Filters:A FLD filter (fluorescent light correction) provides the perfect solution for obtaining pleasing skin tones and correct color while shooting without a flash under fluorescent lighting. This filter gives true-to-life color rendition by removing the harsh yellow-green cast ordinarily resulting from fluorescent bulbs. When shooting under natural light, a fluorescent filter dramatically increases color saturation of subjects such as sunrises and sunsets.Package Contents:1x Ultra Violet (UV) Filter1x Circular Polarizer (CPL) Filter1x Fluorescent (FLD) Filter1x Filter Case", "title": "NEEWER&reg; 58mm 3 Piece Filter Kit (UV-CPL-FLD) for Canon Rebel XSi XT T1i 18-55mm &amp; More!", "price": 8.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41v3QVmAw-L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Neewer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003WD2SLQ", "B004UM7124", "B0025Z7MAE", "B001AO2274", "B002W4RPD2", "B003GTSHY8", "B003Y60DZO", "B0041PO3DU", "B000FW1X4K", "B0041PMD0A", "B003UT6IE0", "B002K40R6G", "B003Y06336", "B004WB8EYM", "B007N83VQM", "B003USYPX2", "B0023VWZ5C", "B003Y58IXO", "B003C8RLAE", "B0017U0WM8", "B004LEAYXY", "B005UFZ7F8", "B00004THD0", "B00AI07F1Y", "B003UT0UEY", "B0069R7TAM", "B003CVLTCW", "B006P59LLS", "B003DWXST2", "B005BDAR5E", "B0080JH3YE", "B004DRCEDW", "B004ZIQ0LG", "B003U7URH6", "B0031AQ302", "B003USW3ZY", "B003Y2954S", "B0056MHU82", "B004K1FTI8", "B00004THCZ", "B0019RGQVU", "B0045DMA42", "B0002Y5WZM", "B00009R6TA", "B005VALUGW", "B001KN74RI", "B005TCMW7S", "B002W50XS0", "B004SHD7JC", "B003UT7RMW", "B00542VVG6", "B002VPE1WK", "B001I3X3HU", "B003F3WCQE", "B00358IMSG", "B005K1Y2GC", "B001Q9A69O", "B008BLTLB4", "B002KF0LGG", "B00005K47X", "B001KN766W", "B002YF6ADU", "B00543FWDI", "B005AAVNQU", "B0065IZHE0", "B006Y0YZZ6", "B0056KCSCM", "B003XMROKG", "B005MSNFUM", "B004YG4J9O", "B004KV4DNK", "B00004ZCJI", "B003XATM94", "B00007E7JU", "B00570DFYQ", "B001KN77RA", "B004VTAVLE", "B002ZIMEMW", "B0087N9K9E", "B001KNE2F0", "B0040YPKFC", "B002K3Z3E8", "B0011NVMO8", "B004NEK126", "B001LMSDNW", "B000TQPTTM", "B001KNAWZ4", "B00004ZCJG", "B005IH0EYM", "B0037NX6JY", "B0051XDOZO", "B002KDQPWM", "B003VNKNF0", "B002ZJOM1C", "B003D0FMS4", "B003N50UY0", "B0055WZPNK", "B004HY7ZQW"], "bought_together": ["B003WD2SLQ", "B003Y60DZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0053V5MF4", "B001KN74RI", "B004SHD7JC", "B00004ZCJI"]}}
