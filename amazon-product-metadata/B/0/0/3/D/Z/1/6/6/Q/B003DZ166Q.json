Simply pull the light out to illuminate Kindle when you need it, and slide it away to be invisible when you don't. And since the light draws its power from Kindle, no batteries are needed.The contoured, pebble-grain leather (available in 7 different colors) keeps your Kindle safe and secure, while the soft charcoal microfiber interior protects the screen from scratches. The cover is designed to fold back, so you can read comfortably with just one hand.", "price": 9.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-BEdqBWSL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SD213O", "B004JXVOD6", "B006BGZJJ4", "B0057WTEWQ", "B004SD1ZPY", "B007OZNUCE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004JXVOD6", "B0056AVI96", "B0057WTEWQ", "B007HCCNJU"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "eBook Readers & Accessories", "Covers"]]}
