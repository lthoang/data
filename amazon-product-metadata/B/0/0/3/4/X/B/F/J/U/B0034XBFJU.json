The cable's RJ45 connectors offer universal connectivity to computers and network components, such as routers, switch boxes, network printers, and network attached storage devices.Built For Superior Network Speed and Reliable Connectivity:The Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable features RJ45 connectors with gold plating for accurate data transfer and reliability. This cable is capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (or 1 Gigabit per second). The faster the speed of your connections, the greater your network's ability to stream video, music, and other data that require high bandwidth. (Please note that your network's speed is determined by many factors in addition to the cables, including your router, switch boxes, and components.)"}
