Now you can kick back        on the sofa and surf all your favorite channels in superior fidelity. With        seven HDMI&reg; 1.4a inputs, the TX-NR708 offers copious connection possibilities,        as well as 3D video compatibility. For your convenience, one of the HDMI        inputs is located on the front panel, along with a USB input for flash memory        devices and iPod&reg; models. If you want to connect a non-HDMI multichannel        component&mdash;say, a legacy SACD or DVD player&mdash;the TX-NR708 sports a full complement        of 7.1-channel analog inputs. The Onkyo name connotes serious audio quality,        so it&rsquo;s no surprise to find low-jitter Burr-Brown DACs and sophisticated        Audyssey MultEQ&reg; room-correction onboard, along with lossless HD audio        formats and the expansive surround dimensions of Audyssey DSX&trade; and        Dolby&reg; Pro Logic&reg; IIz. All of this processing and connectivity power        receives the coveted THX&reg; Select2 Plus&trade; stamp of approval..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; }  ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; }  table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }  td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }", "title": "Onkyo TX-NR708 7.2-Channel Network Home Theater Receiver (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 799.99, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 61201}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BPnzvAoNL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0077V88W2", "B00BLGUKBQ", "B00JPJ33MO", "B00505F01E", "B00BLGUKDE", "B004O0TRD8", "B0077V88VI", "B00BLGUKEI", "B007JOO4YS", "B007JOO4XE", "B00JPITXBK", "B00CLXO14K", "B002DSMNPC", "B003N197EI", "B00CILJB0E", "B004UR486G", "B00HN1S44I", "B008BDBPT8", "B003P2V52M", "B00GXG198M", "B008J834ZS", "B00IQ0SE22", "B0077V88YU", "B00CO07C6E", "B007R8U5R6", "B00B981F4M", "B0077V8930", "B00IQ0SDVY", "B007JF85WE", "B00B981F1U", "B00BHC7ZTE", "B004QOA92A", "B005E1HWN8", "B004U403XQ", "B00EE18O7W", "B00ILCS182", "B008J834YY", "B00CAAJDP6", "B00IJH57I6", "B00ILCRZRK", "B00KLC5YPS", "B00BQHCC48", "B00B981F2Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077V88W2", "B00BLGUKBQ", "B006U3O566", "B003FW0WIK"]}}
