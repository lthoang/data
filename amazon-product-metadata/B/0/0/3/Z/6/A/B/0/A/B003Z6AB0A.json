SleepPhones by AcousticSheep are the most comfortable headphones to wear to sleep all night long. Just choose your favorite sleep soundtrack on your MP3 player, CD player, white noise machine, TV, or any other audio device and plug in SleepPhones. Regular headphones and ear buds are bulky and painful for side sleepers. Developed by a family physician, these innovative high-quality headphones allow you to fall asleep naturally, without drugs, by listening to relaxing music. SleepPhones connect to most devices via a standard 1/8 inch (3.5 mm) mini-jack and a 4 foot (120 cm) cable. Lightweight and washable, the wicking fleece SleepPhones headband contains thin removable (and replaceable) speakers. You spend a third of your life sleeping...make it enjoyable with SleepPhones.", "title": "AcousticSheep SleepPhones Classic Sleep Headphones (Black, Extra Large)", "price": 39.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3119G1Kp8TL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "AcousticSheep, LLC", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004C7UMQY", "B00K7RTOJ4", "B00GXD3AXC", "B0036ZZ72W", "B008BN75I8", "B004K1EK7Y", "B003E623C0", "B0046H8ZJQ", "B003LZQGN6", "B0002BK7KU", "B0015NZ6FK", "B00024CRC8", "B000CCI4YU"], "bought_together": ["B004C7UMQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004C7UMQY", "B0036ZZ72W"]}}
