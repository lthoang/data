Developed in collaboration with Panasonic Hollywood Laboratory, this high image processing technology reproduces clear, vivid colors that are faithful to the original film.Panasonic's Blu-ray Disc players employ high precision 4:4:4 signal technology, which working in tandem with PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus processes each pixel of the Blu-ray Disc video signal in the horizontal direction to compliment vertical direction processing. P4HD (Pixel Precision Progressive Processing for HD) is another technology that contributes to the superior picture quality of the Blu-ray players. P4HD processes more than 15 billion pixels per second and applies the optimal processing to every pixel.Panasonic's Blu-ray Disc players further utilize 16-level motion detection to categorize the image motion of each pixel into one of 16 levels; diagonal processing to detect diagonals and correct the pixels accordingly; 1080p up-conversion to up-convert content recorded in the 480i/p or 720p format to 1080p.This Blu-ray Disc player also provides 1080/24p output, reproducing cinema images from a Blu-ray Disc and DVD in their original 24p form with no need for conversion--enabling you to enjoy cinema images in the same format used in cinema with a 1080/24p-compatible TV.Complimenting the HD audio codecs, the BD65 Blu-ray Disc player features 96kHz surround re-master, a function that enhances the sound quality of CDs and other sources, and even improves the quality of the multi-channel audio data on Blu-ray Discs and DVDs.", "title": "Panasonic DMP-BD65 Blu-Ray Disc Player (Black) (2010 Model)", "price": 142.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VkxDsKX8L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0038KR8WM", "B001V9LA44", "B006H8WFU2", "B00752R4Y6", "B004LNFJCQ", "B0038KLM9W", "B004M8SBFW", "B004OF9XMI", "B00752R5Z4", "B00752R4QO", "B004G8HXXO", "B00752R4PK", "B007WF1IMK", "B0082NJ5BC", "B0091VAHIO", "B00AYB3OMG", "B00AYB3OOY", "B004XYJKHS", "B00HPMCPJK", "B004XYJKHI", "B00B9JR5H2", "B0036WS4CA", "B001VYZVBC", "B00752R4S2", "B001GAOYCS", "B001VZ1W5U", "B004OVEYTO", "B0078GCLRY", "B006U1YVZ8", "B00AWX6EYQ", "B005NEZDUA", "B00BFRKYVM", "B003ZXE87A", "B0038KV0BM", "B006U1YUZE", "B00BFDHVAS", "B003960G1U", "B004K1EOCA", "B001URWAYG", "B00B9JR5EU", "B004T6VT74", "B00F6B3ULE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AWKC0JM", "B00AYB3OMG", "B00AWKC0EC", "B003L1ZYYM"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Blu-ray Players & Recorders", "Blu-ray Players"]]}
