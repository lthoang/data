Designed to carry an equal amount of camera and personal gear, the Passport Sling offers flexibility and comfort when using it around town or sightseeing. Wear it across the body, high and close or low and loose, depending on your activity. The shoulder strap features a cam lock buckle that easily adjusts for an ideal fit, plus a removable, sliding shoulder pad that offers cushioned comfort when you need it. On the exterior, two slash pockets and a water bottle pocket provide quick access to maps, guide books, boarding passes - anything you want to grab in a flash. Inside, the Passport Sling is fully equipped to protect your DSLR and a few accessories as well as offer plenty of space for your personal items. Unzip the front of the Passport Sling to reveal an expansion compartment that adds approximately 30% more space - enough to accommodate items like a light jacket, lunch, cool souvenir or farmers&#x2019; market find. A fully padded camera box (with built-in memory card pocket) protects your DSLR when you&#x2019;re wearing the bag. Remove it and collapse the box when you want to pack the Passport Sling in a larger bag for travel. Additional features include: contrast lining on pockets and interior to provide high visibility to gear; a removable, padded divider with a wing to customize your camera kit; plus two interior pockets with Velcro closures - ideal for stashing personal electronics, keys or other small items. The Passport Sling is available in Black and Mica."}
