{"asin": "B003XOR00I", "description": "The Corsair Hydro Series H70 is the best choice for high performance CPU cooling. A worthy big brother to the already excellent Hydro Series H50, the H70 improves upon the design in every way. A low profile pump and improved cold plate allow for even easier mounting to your CPU. Compatibility with all modern AMD and Intel desktop CPU sockets is included in the box. A higher-performance radiator with nearly twice the surface provides even more room for liquid to get cool before it returns to the cold plate. And as if that weren't enough, the Hydro Series H70 comes with twin high-performance 120 mm fans, optimized for a push-pull configuration, to allow maximum airflow through the radiator. The Corsair Hydro Series H70 is the best choice for a high performance CPU cooler on the market, bar none.", "title": "Corsair Hydro Series H70 High Performance CPU Cooler CWCH70", "price": 109.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hykvU7YKL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B009ZN03AA", "B005QUQP8U", "B004MYFOE2", "B00A0HZMGA", "B009VV56TY", "B009ZN2NH6", "B005QUQP8K", "B009SJR3GS", "B0051U7HMS", "B00B4OCWDE", "B00FZHWFEW", "B004OD7N0O", "B002QG2H7K", "B00B20OYUE", "B00B20OYUY", "B00B4OCW7K", "B00KU2CVJ6", "B00HKEI3EY", "B00KLTHMH4", "B006588Z7G", "B00FFCB0BG", "B00D2LGRO2", "B007RESFYK", "B00E0EXYDC", "B003S68Q0Y", "B00DZL8670", "B00HSY20DQ", "B004WO17UC", "B00DN3IT7M", "B008O0ZKLM", "B004X63JWS", "B00D12OBZ4", "B003WE9WR8", "B004NRQDQQ", "B008B6ONXA", "B00JZ4SN4C", "B006I2H0YS", "B007RESGGC", "B00BCXF4JQ", "B000OGX5AM", "B007QQ4638", "B00JD4TDIO", "B00BCXF6JE", "B00KPRWAX8", "B006I2H084", "B00EUPV2RQ", "B007RESFHM", "B008HD3E6Y", "B00DZL863Y", "B0051U1XMI", "B004O0PAKW", "B00HEYRRXS", "B004UE1W9K", "B00BCXF6O4", "B00CEHGOFC", "B0037AKXKM", "B00D6GINF4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009ZN03AA", "B000OGX5AM", "B00CO8TBQ0", "B006EWUO22"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "CPU Cooling Fans"]]}
