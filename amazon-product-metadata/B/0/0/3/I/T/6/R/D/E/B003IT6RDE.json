{"asin": "B003IT6RDE", "description": "Protect your investment in your Intel or AMD CPU, and make it run better. Excessive heat is the deadly enemy of high-performance silicon, and the Air Series A50 CPU cooler can extend your CPU&#x2019;s lifetime by efficiently drawing that heat away. You&#x2019;ll get faster performance, too. Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors automatically overclock when conditions are right. Add the A50 and your CPU will detect that it&#x2019;s running cooler, and instantly boost its speed when you need it. Of course, if you&#x2019;re not using a Core i5 or Core i7 or if you prefer to overclock manually, the Air Series A50 will still give you the temperature headroom you need. Spend 15 minutes installing the A50 and enjoy years of improved CPU performance.", "title": "Corsair Air Series A50 Performance CPU Cooler CAFA50", "price": 29.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BJVrLrZmL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057FRTPW", "B0045JHJSS", "B007SZ0EJW", "B005G9C4K4", "B006I2H0YS", "B006EKJCWM", "B007SZ0E1K", "B0036Q7MV0", "B006EWUO22", "B005O65JXI", "B005ILWY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005O65JXI", "B000OGX5AM", "B0088PUEPK", "B009VV56TY"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "CPU Cooling Fans"]]}
