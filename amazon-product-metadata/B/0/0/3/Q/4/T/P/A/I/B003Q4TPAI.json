Where creation evolved to a higher plane. Where the sweet and spicy blend of black tea, honey, vanilla bean and spices brought perfection to your world. Experience nirvana after every cup morning, noon or night. An original chai tea latte has approximately 30 35 mg of caffeine per serving. Today, Oregon Chai is part of the Kerry, Inc. Family. And as the first to bring authentic chai to the United States, we now spend our \"everydays\" striving to remain true to our Oregonian roots while serving up me time wherever, whenever we can. That's why at Oregon chai, we use organic and natural ingredients in all our products. In fact, most of Oregon chai's 32 ounce. Concentrates are over 90 percent organic perhaps you noticed the USDA organic seal."}
