{"asin": "B003A7CDY6", "description": "OverviewHigh Quality RJ45 350 Mhz Category 5 Enhanced Cat5e Ethernet Patch CableGearIt Cat5e cables are made of 100% bare copper wire as opposed to copper clad aluminum (CCA) wire, therefore fully compliant with UL Code 444, which require pure bare copper wire in Cat5e communications cables. This high performance cable is perfect for your network installation. Our Cat5e patch cables are used by major data centers around the world.Built For Superior Network Speed and Reliable ConnectivityThe Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable features RJ45 connectors with gold plating for accurate data transfer and reliability. This cable is capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (or 1 Gigabit per second). The faster the speed of your connections, the greater your network&#39;s ability to stream video, music, and other data that require high bandwidth. (Please note that your network&#39;s speed is determined by many factors in addition to the cables, including your router, switch boxes, and components.)Technical SpecificationsConnector Type: RJ45 4 Twisted PairsConnectors: 50um Gold-PlatedCable Wiring: UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) 24AWG Stranded Copper to Minimize Noise and InterferenceData Transmitting Speed: Up To 1000 Mbps (1 Gigabit/sec) *actual speeds depends on your network and equipment setupCable Jacket: Durable RoHS Compliant PVCSnagless Design: For Network Adapters, Hubs, Switches, Routers, DSL/Cable Modems, Patch Panels, Data Center and Other High Performance Networking ApplicationsCompliant: Category TIA-568-C.2, UL 444Warranty: Lifetime Replacement Warranty", "title": "30 FT RJ45 CAT 5E MOLDED NETWORK CABLE - WHITE - Lifetime Warranty", "price": 9.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31s5myU8fIL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008AWL3", "B001OZFCI0", "B003F1S9K4", "B00008AWL4", "B000VDPBXM", "B00005129E", "B0007OGTGS", "B0009JGJF2", "B000XJJN60", "B00008AWL2", "B008F0XVVC", "B00HSSRZNC", "B000067SC6", "B00006MJFL", "B001OZODBW", "B00077INZU", "B00006RVPW", "B001OZOCHW", "B006IKHP8Q", "B003BU0EKW", "B00HSSRWDU", "B00006B834", "B004XXMUCQ", "B000E891P8", "B005H4CDF4", "B00023DRLO", "B0002DV0G8", "B00D8NC2YI", "B0060RUVDS", "B004D5PFGW", "B00C2CA3N8", "B00IO3HJGI", "B001DW8J5C", "B005G2JFEO", "B00BGTPPSQ", "B00HSSRYGA", "B003CFATU6", "B008X3JHJQ", "B0000BVYT3", "B00GE1DHNQ", "B0000AZK4D", "B0092TG310", "B0002CWPW2", "B004VUOAPG", "B00C2CBBAM", "B000U3G114", "B006IKGK8M", "B00C2DZBC0", "B0069F4GIM", "B00EEK1114", "B00EEK22TY", "B00HSSROZG", "B004GHMU60", "B0018DOBG2", "B0041W55YE", "B00HSSRUQO", "B006R75I20", "B00BGTPQO4", "B00A16FR10", "B0098SMH4W", "B00002EQCW", "B004GHMU4W", "B00C2BG7ZC", "B00HSSRNU2", "B0072JVU8S", "B000U3DXM4", "B00HM9J6NY", "B00C2DZ9EU", "B000XJLLKG", "B000P1OA1O", "B006IKH2FC", "B003K1NFY4", "B0019804U8", "B000WL326Q", "B00BS92DCK", "B004GHMU5Q", "B001S2PJO6", "B008CR07OM", "B000KMFDZ0", "B0028H1G9C", "B00IO3HGUM", "B00DUYD02I", "B003VANO7C", "B0002V85MW", "B001VSR9SG", "B000E887XU", "B00C2BQDUG", "B007VPKLBU", "B00C2DLI9A", "B003M5BIII", "B00C2B81K6", "B002CT0822", "B0018DKWGA", "B000M0WALA", "B0077252IY", "B006IKH0EA", "B00B2GD29M", "B004D5RFCE", "B004HIN800", "B002HAJQGA"], "bought_together": ["B00008AWL3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00D8NC2YI", "B001OZFCI0", "B003F1S9K4", "B00APOPDSA"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Cables & Interconnects", "Ethernet Cables"]]}
