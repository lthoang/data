{"asin": "B003VSTDFG", "description": "Add a network interface to your computer via USB. Common uses include adding wired network support to Chromebooks and Android tablets, improving speeds vs. 10/100 adapters and wireless networks, replacing a broken internal network card, adding a separately routable network interface, and transferring files peer-to-peer over Ethernet. It is not a solution for connecting a USB device like a printer to a network.PerformancePlug into any USB 2.0 laptop or desktop currently limited to 10/100 Ethernet, and benefit from faster transfers on your Gigabit ethernet network. USB 2.0 supports theoretical speeds up to 480Mbs. In practice, most machines will see up to a doubling of network speed by moving from 100Mbs Fast Ethernet to 1000Mbs Gigabit ethernet via USB. Also works on 10/100 ethernet networks at their native speeds.DriversMicrosoft signed 32/64-bit drivers for Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, ME, and Win98SE. Not compatible with ARM-based Windows (MS Surface). Mac OS X 10.6+ 32/64-bit requires latest driver via download. Linux kernels prior to 3.3 require rebuild of kernel module from source. Not compatible with Tivo Series 2, or Wii.Driverless SupportWorks using built-in drivers (no install needed) for all Google Chromebook systems running latest updates (Chrome OS), certain Android systems including ASUS Transformer Prime and Infinity convertible tablets, and systems with Linux kernel 3.3 and higher.Included in PackageUSB 2.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter with standard USB type A connector to PC and female RJ45 jack to network, Quick Install Guide, and Driver Disk for Windows and Mac.", "title": "Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Wired Network Adapter for Windows, Mac, Chromebook, Linux, and Specific Android Tablets (ASIX AX88178 Chipset)", "price": 25.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413kaX1OeRL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009YPYORM", "B00C452XFO", "B00CXAC1ZW", "B0092ZEINO", "B00E3667XQ", "B00EILOVCA", "B00EPVRLNE", "B00AQM8586", "B00F08N4GY", "B005UUY25E", "B00484IEJS", "B00A0ABQLM", "B00EJP5XR2", "B00AKXE59E", "B00B4GGW5Q", "B00608WXGA", "B00IAZRX7A", "B00EB70PXA", "B003ES5ZR8", "B0041ORNCY", "B00BBD7NFU", "B00C2DZAIU", "B00CTY1H6G", "B00BE67N3Q", "B001CY0P7G", "B00608XLUM", "B0007T27H8", "B00A121WN6", "B000VDPBXM", "B00FGKXY9S", "B0000BVYT3", "B008ZGKWQI", "B000Q8UAWY", "B00GN5OHIW", "B00AWL6G8W", "B003ES5ZRS", "B003M0NURK", "B007U5MGDC", "B007RTACDM", "B00HEM656U", "B000N99BBC", "B00FFJ0RKE", "B00C2DL96W", "B00006RVPW", "B008ALA6DW", "B00JY4Q52U", "B005AT2KTK", "B0000TO0BQ", "B00EKTMZ2I", "B00HEME0I0", "B001QUA6R0", "B0044GH27U", "B003VAGXZC", "B009Z8T3K6", "B008634VJY", "B005LDLVAO", "B00DQFGJR4", "B006WAPM78", "B003EE12EC", "B00CZ6WAEQ", "B00965J4TS", "B00ECDM78E", "B00BWF5U0M", "B00AAS88K6", "B006GQHRU8", "B008A3KFB8", "B000IV6S9S", "B0093LINT2", "B00E6LID0S", "B000QYY6EG", "B00939KKX6", "B003CFATNI", "B0055PKSG6", "B00B3X72OU", "B00425S1H8", "B00HZDLNWO", "B00939KFOU", "B00DMCVKMU", "B001NLV4TQ", "B0095EFXMC", "B005T4HT24", "B004PW1XRS", "B00182CIB8", "B00932N46S", "B00358MP02", "B005Y8C2IG", "B000FI9VU2", "B00DTZYHX4", "B00F3U4TQS", "B001PS9E5I", "B00E3W1726", "B002WM8ZV0", "B009NB8WTI", "B00D8YZ2SA", "B000BMZHX2", "B004WL7MIQ", "B00F3ZN0CC", "B004D5PFGW", "B00BS92DCK", "B00023DRLO"], "bought_together": ["B00CXAC1ZW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00484IEJS", "B00AQM8586", "B00BBD7NFU", "B00A0ABQLM"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Cables & Interconnects", "USB Cables"]]}
