The very act of taking your hand away from the grip locks the head into position, which eliminates the extra step of having to tighten a knob or lever before being ready to shoot. You have immediate access to half of a sphere in which to position your camera. The TacShot's body is crafted from high impact polycarbonate with the ball head and internal assemblies made from high quality aluminum. A bull's eye style single bubble level helps quickly achieve a perfectly level shot with just a glance at your hand. The included quick release plates allow you to remove your camera at a moment's notice.The Opteka TacShot can be used with all makes and models of tripods that have either a 1/4\"-20 or a 3/8\"-16 threaded center column post.The Opteka TacShot can support up to 6.6 lbs. For example, that means 35mm up to an 80-200mm f/2.8 lens. This head is ideal for both tripods and monopods."}
