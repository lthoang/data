Designed with high-quality materials, the L3 isolates the audio signal from interference to deliver cleaner and more accurate sound from your iPod/iPhone/iPad.\n\n The L3 employs the new HPC-22W cable with ultra-fine PCOCC-A conductors for its exceptional signal transmission property and usability. Twenty strands of 80&#x3BC;m PCOCC-A wire are unified into a bundle and three bundles are grouped as a conductor that is geometrically stable. This construction method ensures uniformity of wire structure, eliminates internal gaps, and prevents deformation of wire strands. Each conductor in the HPC-22W is jacketed with 0.18mm PFA (Teflon), a material selected for its outstanding electrical and transmission characteristics. The shield/ground consists of 53 strands of 0.12&#x3BC;m PCOCC-A wire, with cotton rope filling the internal space and providing additional tensil strenth. The outer jacket is made of TPE olefinic elastomer.\n\nFeature Highlights\n - Shielded construction provides maximum isolation from interference\n - Pure copper conductors for better audio clarity and a more natural-sounding midrange\n - High quality durable connectors for precise contact and signal integrity\n - Supports standard dock profile on iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Does not support Shuffle.\n\n Specifications\n Length: 8cm (cable only)\n Weight: 10g\n Wire Diameter: 4mm\n Wire Model: HPC-22W\n Wire Material: PCOCC-A\n Impedance: Max 0.1 Ohm\n Insulation: Min 2M Ohm\n Wire Jacket: TPE", "title": "FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone", "price": 9.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IM4bK4P3L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Fiio", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00B6QXWIY", "B0070UFMOW", "B005N6ZAT2", "B004QVPGXK", "B005DK08X6", "B0053KWDES", "B001P9EQH8", "B003UCC78I", "B00A9LHLQ6", "B005HJWWW8", "B008EKON56", "B004QVNS0S", "B003N0XDT4", "B005EV38AE", "B008J26ZL4", "B004BOA6SM", "B00GCDJBMM", "B00KPYMOL4", "B008JGWY2Y", "B009NE7B06", "B00HVLUR86", "B00KQ4EAU6", "B00A2QKSVI", "B007ZG32I4", "B0006NL5SM", "B00D0E8EFQ", "B000EBBJ6Y", "B00I4Q9S32", "B005JT8OT6", "B004H5UYLO", "B009EEGVY2", "B0042A8CW2", "B003N3G7PS", "B00018MSNI", "B004444OFK", "B0051MQHGI", "B006RUIWC0", "B000621N26", "B00GO4GMAI", "B001DK1ZVO", "B000R2PC2M", "B00A2QJPFS", "B007OXK330", "B00BF6IKL4", "B00EPFLJS8", "B00AWLEAH6", "B0051MQIWQ", "B003UCI2CI", "B004QMH8KI", "B004V9GPHS", "B00931SFZO", "B00KAKBHKM", "B00ENO322C", "B003VJX2F2", "B00DI89I04", "B0012OOSQU", "B00E1UVXHO", "B00503KOR6", "B004444O3W", "B00DD2BZRY", "B008D2OPG2", "B000068O4N", "B002Z9JWZS", "B00CICPQTI", "B0091CWYQ6", "B00D73JV6G", "B0041F3A02", "B00B3QD94O", "B00C5DY1JQ", "B000ULAP4U", "B00E4WXWBE", "B004FD1D2C", "B00H00VLZQ", "B0030O0Q2U", "B006DIFXTG", "B00862522A", "B00858I51U", "B007ZSYHYU", "B002VH7P4O", "B00A39PPDK", "B006NH8768", "B000J1N3HW", "B000BQU1F2", "B004HKIAE2", "B000646VDK", "B00CICPN0K", "B00007FGUF", "B00BE50BPO", "B00F2II49Y", "B009D4JNJI", "B0051MQJ2U", "B0007WZLDC", "B005CNR7B0", "B00B0FR2QO", "B0057OI448", "B004LPZBD6", "B00EPFIMKQ"], "bought_together": ["B00B6QXWIY", "B005N6ZAT2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005N6ZAT2", "B0070UFMOW", "B005HJWWW8", "B00B6QXWIY"]}}
