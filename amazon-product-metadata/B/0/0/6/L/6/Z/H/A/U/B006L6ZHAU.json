{"asin": "B006L6ZHAU", "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Computer Cases"]], "description": "As the first chassis in the Precision series designed for Micro ATX motherboards, the PS07 has a great balance between size and functionality. It utilizes SilverStone's vaulted positive pressure design with easily removable filters on both the fans and the power supply to prevent dust buildup. Two front mounted 120mm fans can provide capable cooling for a complete build fully loaded with drives and components. To keep the noise profile low, an independent compartment with isolated intake vent for the power supply was implemented to keep PSU operating at optimal temperature. User-friendly touches such as removable motherboard tray and top lid make installation in such small chassis a breeze. But an all new backside cable routing design further increases PS07's ergonomics with room for long power supply cables; thus eliminates the need for short cable kits such as SilverStone's PP05 and allow users to use any power supplies they wish. For those interested in storage flexibility, PS07's ability to accommodate one 2.5\" and six 3.5\" hard drives are greatly appreciated as well. Using an elegant front panel combined with aluminum accent makes PS07 at home in any environment with a clean, hidden side intake helping to minimize and direct noise away from users. If there is a need for a relatively small, understated, quiet, and advanced PC, the PS07 is a perfect choice.", "title": "Silverstone Tek Micro-ATX Mini-DTX, Mini-ITX Mini Tower Plastic with Aluminum Accent Computer Cases PS07B (Black)", "price": 94.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BWk7vCuTL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Silverstone Tek", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00K2R69PQ", "B00JST2QEW", "B00CRJSYAA", "B00CRJS6OY", "B00CO8TA4I", "B00J2LIFBY", "B0033Z2BAQ", "B00ALYORA4", "B00918MEZG", "B002A17OG0", "B0047CQ1B4", "B00D12OAVE", "B00ALK3HF4", "B0092ML0MY", "B00FU829ZQ", "B00CO8TBNS", "B00E3W1726", "B0092ML1SC", "B002YIG9AQ", "B00J8E8ZLK", "B0088PUEPK", "B007RQ0MDA", "B00CO8TBOW", "B00569K7LM", "B00CO8TBR4", "B005O65JXI", "B00C0RCVLW", "B00E3W15P0", "B004CRSM4I", "B00EUUKVXM", "B00CO8T9VC", "B00CU4L4K4", "B00GXNPJI6", "B00F3ZN0CC", "B0093H8H8I", "B00F3ZN2W0", "B00J56YSLM", "B006YG9EEW", "B0037TO5C0", "B002UOR17Y", "B007TG8QRW", "B007SZ0E1K", "B0087EVHVW", "B00HB77YRW", "B006WAGGUK", "B00IDG3NDY", "B00D1A5OR0", "B00CRJU0KC", "B00CRJSW7A", "B00CO8TBQ0", "B007RIFMQA", "B0057Q4ADU", "B00GH9NBP4", "B00K2R6EGA", "B0035FIS2O", "B00H09BOXQ", "B00918MQ8G", "B00C9EYVGY", "B00DGHDQVO", "B00DTPYT78", "B00650P2ZC", "B007ZWL4A6", "B00ESETQNG", "B00KFAGCWK", "B00FJRS628", "B005DDCDH2", "B00EUUN76U", "B00BZIIEDG", "B00BQ8RM1A", "B000OGX5AM", "B00CE58ZYC", "B007SZ0EHE", "B00EB7UIO6", "B002BH3Z8E", "B0093H8GQG", "B0092ML0OC", "B00CO8T9VW", "B0083U94D8", "B00COGDERY", "B00H09BB16", "B008O510FW", "B009NB8WRU", "B00339X1EM", "B006EWUO22", "B007OCJWTM", "B008YAHW6I", "B00EF1G9DW", "B008JJLZ7G", "B00D38U4GQ", "B008F65MO0", "B007QWIA9S", "B00EUAFAF6", "B007YDJJFS", "B00F0RD3ZM", "B00840BAIE", "B0098FSJ92", "B00DVTBM2W"], "bought_together": ["B0033Z2BAQ", "B0088PUEPK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DDCDH2", "B005T3GRNW", "B0088PUEPK", "B00COGDERY"]}}
