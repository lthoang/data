Attach a powered USB hub to the USB2-SWITCH2 instead of a single device for switched access to everything connected to the hub.FeaturesThe USB2-SWITCH2 works without drivers on any USB-enabled computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). Connect two computers to the switch via the included five-foot USB A/B cables, attach either a single USB device or a USB hub connected to multiple USB devices (cable not included for switch-to-device/hub attachment), and start enjoying the benefits of switched access. Driver installation for the attached devices may be required on the connected computers.A single button press is all that's required to change control of the attached devices between the connected computers. LED indicator lights show which connected computer has control.For anyone considering a KVM switch to provide two-computer access to a single keyboard, mouse, and display, the same result is possible with the Plugable USB2-SWITCH2. Just attach the switch to a powered USB hub that's connected to a keyboard, mouse, and USB graphics adapter for an all-USB KVM solution.The switch can connect USB 2.0/1.1-compliant devices and hubs, but to function in USB 2.0 speed mode, the connected computer and attached device or hub both must comply with the USB 2.0 standard.What's in the BoxOne Plugable USB2-SWITCH2 compact USB 2.0/1.1 switch with two USB-B female ports and one USB-A female portTwo five-foot USB A/B cables for connecting two computers to the switch", "title": "Plugable USB 2.0 Switch for One-Button Swapping of USB Device/Hub Between Two Computers", "price": 12.95, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PNwNf%2BoqL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MSU1HG", "B003M0NURK", "B001TH7GUA", "B00BCWALHM", "B00BCWA6TK", "B000IZECH4", "B00BWF5U0M", "B003Z4G3I6", "B00DQFGJR4", "B002K0TU2C", "B002W8EDOM", "B00C7RJQPY", "B00FDK1S94", "B001MSZBNA", "B001SEB45M", "B001TH7GUU", "B002LVUIS0", "B00IU1R29I", "B005RISB3S", "B003VTZ07U", "B00BP5KOPA", "B004CAGDSW", "B00BD8I2OY", "B006LFL4X0", "B00IT1WJZQ", "B00C28L6XI", "B004C9P9TM", "B003M6FDS8", "B0053WXOMQ", "B006HXUXRY", "B005HKIDF2", "B00E9IFDBU", "B008GVOVK0", "B004TXPWV6", "B008VIH63M", "B00ECDM78E", "B003MAZY6A", "B00007AP2O", "B007NJ0S1W", "B001D1UTC4", "B000FNFSPY", "B005H3Q59U", "B00B46XUQU", "B001MXLD4G", "B00870ZHCQ", "B00004Z5PY", "B008ZGKWQI", "B005H3Q5E0", "B001TH7T2U", "B0043T34RK", "B00K8AB1MI", "B0000X0VCY", "B00066GNWW", "B00EO58Z5O", "B008HBFADQ", "B003VANO7C", "B000HPX46U", "B00HZWOQZ6", "B00GLZYG6M", "B004LT8MN8", "B003VAHYNC", "B009WA2NKY", "B005C2BNJI", "B00E5I7VJG", "B004AGX4YO", "B001603YQU", "B00DYQYJ3Q", "B0007MWE1E", "B008ALA6DW", "B000OOYECC", "B00DQFGH80", "B00H33SFJU", "B00483WRZ6", "B003ES5ZR8", "B00APLJY4C", "B00BBD7NFU", "B001MSU1FS", "B00FJRS6FU", "B00879DM56", "B00004Z5M1", "B007NLW3C2", "B003VTZ070", "B007NLEF3W", "B00B3P1IGG", "B0052SCU8U", "B001E1Y5O6", "B0049KV52E", "B003822IRA", "B00080G0BK", "B003YFHCKY", "B00EDSI7QO", "B00DG54ARU", "B009UEBQIM", "B002TOL40A", "B00I5SW8MC", "B008ABOJKS", "B00ATZ9QMO", "B00507GV38", "B001JZ50SC"], "bought_together": ["B001MSU1HG", "B00BWF5U0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BD8I2OY", "B00FEM3OKM", "B001SEB45M", "B002K0TU2C"]}}
