Dual contains all of the elements of Solo along with a second handle and extra articulation for the shoulder support. Shooting handheld can be quite difficult and often results in shaky, undesirable footage, especially when unforeseen conditions arise. If you're not using the right equipment it can be even tougher to get the smooth movement you want. Whether you're covering a live event, a wedding, or shooting a film, the right handheld rig can take your project to the next level. Simples is a lightweight, modular solution that's designed to be mobile and flexible so you can capture your footage smoothly, the way you want it to be seen. The key advantage to using Simples versus another camera support rig is the modular philosophy behind it. Simples is a building block that will allow you to grow at the pace you need to without ever having to discard your kit and buy an entire new system. We believe that your camera support equipment is an investment and not a temporary solution.", "title": "Cinevate SIMP0000 Simplis Solo DSLR Support Rig (Black)", "price": 399.98, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yImvTpLmL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Cinevate", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B005MRXPE4", "B004816LZA", "B0052YJPNC", "B00C63Z7WK", "B005UF3G2Y", "B008BI3SN4", "B00AWZFHG0", "B008X1C1DC", "B004G9QRBM", "B004K8WPUQ", "B00A2WTNZE", "B007FGYZFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MRXPE4"]}}
