Herbal power: supports kidney function and healthy digestion. Reason to love: one person&#x2019;s weed is another person&#x2019;s wonder-herb. With a name stemming from French translation dent &#x2013; de &#x2013; lion, literally meaning tooth of a lion, dandelions are easily identified not just by their bright yellow flowers, but also by their long, jagged, tooth-like leaves. Traditionally used to support kidney function by promoting flushing of the kidneys, we love how this blend of dandelion leaf and unroasted dandelion root also helps promote happy and healthy digestion. Taste: enjoyably mild and sweet."}
