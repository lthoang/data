This device transmits music from your Zune into an FM frequency that can be picked up by your radio tuner. You can automatically select an optimal station for broadcast using the auto-tuning Zune FM Transmitter. It often takes more than one station to stay tuned in if you drive between different regions with different stations, that's why the Zune FM Transmitter has two presets so you can easily swap back and forth between your most commonly used broadcast stations. To keep up with a long road trip, you can charge your Zune while listening to music in the car. The magnetic storage clip allows you to keep wires out of your way, and the dashboard grip pad provides a great place to rest your device in the car. It is compatible with all Zunes.What's in the Box:FM transmitter/charger, dashboard grip pad, product quick start guide, product manual.", "title": "Zune Car Pack", "price": 24.75, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zSceKk0OL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Zune", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000IXNEI4", "B000VWPULQ", "B000VWOKQM", "B000IXP932", "B000MUBEDU", "B000IXQPNK", "B000VWKSHM", "B002WB433U", "B002JPITZ2", "B000EPLP3C", "B002JPITY8", "B000IXQPJO", "B002SKVYZA", "B00ADF0WDW", "B000IXP96Y", "B000XPG2YU", "B002JPITXY", "B000H0QDCC", "B000VWKSFE", "B000WG6XW6", "B001TJIZTY", "B000IXLHOM", "B001XYBWXQ", "B000IXP946", "B002SNCSKC", "B000WFZSBE", "B000IXP96O", "B002JPITYS", "B002RL8VB0", "B00487IONQ", "B003JYZE0A", "B001EQ0HAW", "B002URXRI8", "B00308CRDM", "B0017HEZE2", "B001EWDFCI", "B004798MKA", "B003OOBH56", "B0017HEZDS", "B003ES5GWW", "B00176AX6W", "B00166QHKE", "B002EBF0OY", "B000OXOITW", "B001GQVSI0", "B000LQZNZ0", "B000X1U1EQ", "B000FMZE7W", "B000OP8BVG"], "bought_together": ["B000IXNEI4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VWPULQ", "B002JPITZ2", "B000VWOKQM", "B000IXNEI4"]}}
