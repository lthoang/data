The discs  offer  nearly double the capacity of standard DVD+R formats, with two AZO recording  layers  on a single-sided disc. As a result, you can store a ton of information without  having to  flip the disc in the middle of a movie. In addition, the discs are supported by  high-speed  double-layer DVD writers (up to 10x), letting you burn 8.5 GB of information in  roughly  12 to 15 minutes. Best of all, the discs still maintain playback compatibility  with most  DVD players and DVD-ROM drives. Compatible with DVD+R DL recording drives from  Sony, Philips, Lite On, and other manufacturers, the discs are backed by a limited  lifetime warranty.What's in the BoxFive discs, five jewel cases."}
