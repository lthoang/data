First, develop and source the absolute best possible solutions for the preparation, installation and hand termination of wire and cable. Second, implement an operational infrastructure that can deliver these products in an efficient, timely and high quality manner. All of our products absolutely must satisfy three critical benchmark criteria: utility of function, quality of function, and economic value. The patented Platinum 100010C EZ-RJ45 Cat 6+ Connector simplifies twisted pair terminations by allowing the wires to be inserted through the connector and out the front. This allows the technician to easily verify the proper wiring order. The electrical performance of the termination is optimized by pulling the connector down over the cable jacket and seating it tightly in the rear of the connector. This reduces the distance between the wire twists and contacts. When terminating your EZ connectors, twist all your extended conductors together into one tight bundle and then insert into your EZ crimp tool to be terminated. Tools designed for installing these connectors are the recommended Platinum 100004 EZ-RJ45 Crimp Tool, 100044C EZ-RJPRO Crimp Tool, and the 100054C EZ-RJPRO HD Crimp Tool, each sold separately. The clamshell connector's simple one piece design with no bars or liners works with solid or stranded wire. With category 6 performance per EIA/TIA B.2., the 100010C connector is for use in Cat 6 compliant data networks. The connectors are FCC compliant and UL rated and Platinum Strain Reliefs are required for Category 6 compliance. The Platinum Tools 100010C EZ-RJ45 Cat 6+ Connectors are sold 50 parts to a package and are covered by a limited manufacturer warranty."}
