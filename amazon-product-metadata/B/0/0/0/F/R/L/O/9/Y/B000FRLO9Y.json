The Multi US 7002 features multiple charging modes, as well as a unique 8-step charging curve. Taken together these refined and new technologies allow the Multi US 7002 to move far beyond the capabilities of other 12V chargers, even to the point of determining whether a battery can hold the charge given, and in the process ensure that each of your lead-acid vehicle batteries gets the best possible care..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; }  ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; }  table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }  td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Eight-step Automatic Battery Charging CycleGoing forward, there is no need for any specific knowledge of batteries        or their charging methods; CTEK's Multi US 7002 will take care of that.        Once you switched to the preferred mode, the charger takes its own readings        and then begins to charge the battery in 8 steps. These include: desulphation,        allowing for possible reconditioning of batteries that have lost power due        nonuse.; Soft Start, which charges until the battery's terminal voltage        has risen to a preset level; Bulk, in which primary charging to approximately        80% occurs; Absorption, a final charging stage where voltage is kept at        a preset level; Analysis, during which charging a suspended and voltage        measured; Recondition, where the battery is fed a constant current of 1.5A        and maximum voltage of 15.7V; Float, during which constant voltage is maintained;        and finally Pulse/Maintenance Charging, in which the battery receives a        pulse of electricity when the voltage drops below 95%, keeping the battery        in perfect condition indefinitely when it is not used. The Multi US 7002        is also perfectly suited for Optima Yellow Top batteries and can also be        connected for months, which is ideal for seasonal vehicles.", "title": "CTEK Multi US 7002 12V Battery Charger", "price": 98.58, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XbjdIEr6L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Kinetik", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0016LA5O8", "B002MT8S7E", "B00B4ELMU8", "B002X6DQUA", "B002OHXX60", "B009K2QX0U", "B00B4EQ6LS", "B002OHN5NQ", "B0015PI7A4", "B006G14FK8", "B000FQBWCY", "B002X67JYE", "B002MT72YE", "B002OHSIEW", "B00COPZ842", "B002X6DQV4", "B0045F3SGY", "B006CQ9BMO", "B00ADIHUVG", "B004MLZURG", "B000EVWDU0", "B00ACNO2AO", "B009M3PQFA", "B004XH6SCK", "B002UUSBMC", "B004W5SGBO", "B000K09OL6", "B000CPI5XW", "B00E16LU7Q", "B005FCXWB2", "B00EVWX7CG", "B00316KFV4", "B000VYZ1HW", "B000K2MABA", "B0012GMDC4", "B000BZI4KC", "B001PTHKMG", "B0034A8C4O", "B007B8JMZI", "B0042VII7A", "B005ADJ58U", "B0042F3JCK", "B0002X7V1Q", "B006P1QWOQ", "B00062UKIY", "B000CMDPLM", "B00CPL8PSG", "B005ZWM0R4", "B00FQHY64S", "B000BO9J52", "B000THQ0CQ", "B000MITKOM", "B00606DWSK", "B005UWD2J4", "B000221M94", "B001QRTZR0", "B00791R1BO", "B00004WKI3", "B007Q2HOYK", "B001HWGML6", "0760344035", "B0028OJAIY", "B0009H1AMG", "B000N3W8J0", "B004B8GTQG", "B000P17NXQ", "B003C01FD6", "B000BL5INM", "B006QH55YW", "B0090DX8O8", "B0030Z95B2", "B004NNUEWY", "B00CSQYVWM", "B00E3667XQ", "B004RNOVTM", "B007SLDDHQ", "B00FNK8UQS", "B004YI9NTS", "B005TJMC0S", "B0014FKI1Q"], "also_viewed": ["B000FQBWCY", "B006G14FK8", "B0016LA5O8", "B002MT8S7E", "B00D8DTG6U", "B004UK0WO0", "B002OHXX60", "B00B4ELMU8", "B0045F3SGY", "B002QUT8IC", "B004LWTHP2", "B00B4EQ6LS", "B004INGZR2", "B006CQ9BMO", "B00GODGN9E", "B009K2QX0U", "B001684YCK", "B004LWVEKS", "B00D8DWEVE", "B002X6DQUA", "B00GODCLYU", "B000JFLSL6", "B000O707IO", "B005LBCVL4", "B002MT72YE", "B004LX14Z2", "B005EKY1EM", "B001MYWBF0", "B00COPZ842", "B009M3PQFA", "B008TDALJ0", "B00068XCQU", "B005EKY20K", "B0015PI7A4", "B00ADIHUVG", "B000NCOKV0", "B002OHSIEW", "B002DU3S9A", "B001JSTM8I", "B00DHGPVKI", "B00LJZS44O", "B001684X76", "B004LX3AXQ", "B008TDAKGE", "B002HGFS3O", "B000BQSIWK", "B00JT5TDG4", "B003UANXCE", "B002OHN5NQ", "B004LX3AS6", "B0009IBJE4", "B008TDAMTY", "B002X67JU8", "B000H961YI", "B000NCOKQK", "B000CITK8S", "B00EO6TWT6", "B00AFSWHB2", "B001U04MPS", "B00CBTRMZ4"], "bought_together": ["B0016LA5O8", "B002MT8S7E"]}}
