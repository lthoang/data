{"asin": "B000FQ9YB0", "description": "The WarioWare team took an idea so wacky, it could only be made with the latest technology: the Wii Remote controller! Wario stumbles into an old building called the Temple of Form. Inside, he finds a mystical treasure called the Form Baton. There are many ways to hold and move the baton (called \"forms\"), and legend has it that if the holder follows the forms, he can overcome any challenge. With this discovery, the form craze spreads and soon everybody is doing their best to master the moves. Features: &#8226; Revolutionary Fun: With hundreds of microgames, this game is just as wild as you'd expect from the name WarioWare, but the gameplay has been revolutionized. Under Wario's tutelage and with the help of the Wii Remote, players will swing, spin and squat their way to victory. &#8226; Tons and Tons of Microgames: With more than 200 lightning-quick microgames and controls that range from scribbling to flailing, WarioWare: Smooth Moves takes interactive gaming to a whole new level. All players need is confidence, a Wii Remote and their best moves. &#8226; Off-Screen Party: With games that are as much fun to play as they are to watch people play, WarioWare: Smooth Moves brings the party to its feet. It's hilarious for players and audiences alike.", "price": 61.49, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TYeGaZDhL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001C58T46", "B000LSJKAM", "B0001JSSLS", "B0007D4MVS", "B006L1FAK2", "B001TERJD2", "B004CUOD70", "B003ZCH7DI", "B000FQ9R4E", "B000INV44U", "B000FQ9QVI", "B000YDIYFG", "B0050SVGU0", "B000P297ES", "B001TOQ8K2", "B000G7PMX2", "B0033BJSDI", "B001GIUWX0", "B000GPW2QO", "B00CHYOP94", "B008E6ZXK4", "B000TP2UZO", "B000Z9A95M", "B002BSA388", "B00KI2OZ9M", "B000FQBPDU", "B001PBDBNQ", "B005EHQJ2C", "B003JD7QYI", "B004WLRQMI", "B001TOMR0C", "B000CC3IEQ", "B008GFZV6Y", "B003O6DZSQ", "B002BRZ9G0", "B000KUHR8S", "B000NNDN1M", "B005FYJA52", "B005EIIBKY", "B00DC7G0GG", "B0094X28J0", "B00DC7G2W8", "B000GHLBUA", "B004ZI8SCU", "B003ZHMMEM", "B001TOQ8OI", "B000R3BNE2", "B002FG9MWE", "B00008KUA3", "B00KWEHBAG", "B00I5LMSE2", "B000NKRJAG", "B007CSF3GO", "B0094X1ZXU", "B000OAO188", "B000VLJQ76", "B000WINB56", "B002BSC4ZS", "B0058CA4S8", "B0000A09EP", "B0013E9HP6", "B00DC7FWRE", "B0007D4MW2", "B002EE7OKE", "B0017Q4DGI", "B000IMWK2G", "B001TOMQVM", "B005EIIS4S", "B002BHSPXO", "B0037US4IA", "B000ZKNAFW", "B008171AZ8", "B000FQBPCQ", "B004W1IX1G", "B0002ILS24", "B000070IWB", "B00009PS24", "B002I0GEXM", "B000FW362C", "B000R4809W", "B0016OVBG6", "B002I0K3CK", "B002BRYXOO", "B003M31RN6", "B0094X2066", "B0000A0O28", "B000JV78XC", "B0081716P2", "B002I0IIPY", "B001HB7K6I"], "bought_together": ["B001GIUWX0", "B002BRZ9G0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001C58T46", "B003ZCH7DI", "B000VLJQ76", "B005EHQJ2C"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2460}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family", "Wii", "Games"], ["Video Games", "Wii", "Games"]]}
