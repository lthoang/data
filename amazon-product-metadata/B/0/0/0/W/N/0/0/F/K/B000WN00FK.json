V-Moda's highly-regarded V-Masque dynamic driver provides unparalleled clarity and high-definition sound for optimum communication capabilities or the ultimate music listening experience.V-MODA's \"Sculpted Sound Curve\"Designed to mimic the warm, sweet sound of hi-fi stereo speakers, the Vibe Duo Nero's sound curve remains amazingly straight  with no bass roll-off which delivers a smooth and detailed bass response.  A sensitivity dip in the 500hz to 2kHz range accentuates the bass slightly and reproduces a warm soundstage.  The gentle dropoff in the high ranges was carefully designed to avoid harsh or \"clinical\"-sounding highs, making the Vibes suitable as in-ear monitors.", "title": "V-MODA Vibe Duo In-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone with Universal One-Button Mic (Chrome) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 118.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l4hoypjIL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "V-MODA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002XYUHFY", "B0018M8L6O", "B0038W0NOU", "B003J5FWGK", "B006DK65A0", "B008MW7SLW", "B003J5GGO2", "B005LD275M", "B007TEQNBK", "B002X866S2"], "bought_together": ["B003J5FWGK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038W0NOU", "B006DK65A0", "B0018M8L6O", "B008MW7SLW"]}}
