It's been the Bose approach to better sound since Dr. Amar G. Bose founded the company in 1964. But the commitment actually began years earlier.In the late 1950s, Dr. Bose, then a graduate student, purchased a stereo system based on its impressive technical specifications. The avid music enthusiast was disappointed to discover the speakers didn't reproduce the sound of a live performance--and he became determined to recreate that lifelike audio experience for listeners.After extensive research, Dr. Bose and colleagues introduced the groundbreaking 901 Direct/Reflecting speakers in 1968. Their lifelike sound won immediate and widespread acclaim.Since those early days of 901 speakers, Bose engineers have kept their focus on creating better technology. You'll find that focus exemplified in the Computer MusicMonitor, with advances that ensure premium performance and convenience.", "title": "Bose&reg; Computer MusicMonitor&reg; -- Silver", "price": 299.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L0UesWwqL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Bose", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0053T4PHC", "B00134JNJG", "B004444O46", "B0083J8ETE", "B001VADVP4", "B004444O4G", "B004444O50", "B004LKRTD6", "B00IEZGWI2", "B000WAHFBK", "B000CMTV3I", "B002OSY3WW", "B008I64O78", "B004444O6E", "B004444O5U", "B002GQM2MA", "B00CIBU8TM", "B004444O3W", "B00A8LZ5GU", "B004444O5A", "B0030O0Q2U", "B004BDOQB6", "B0097LY7Y8", "B00CD1FB26", "B004444OFK", "B001LNO722", "B00009R6WY", "B003G3DM58", "B001A62M04", "B0057FOD4W", "B003YJAZZ4", "B00DD62ZW4", "B0013P3ZOE", "B00D5Q75RC", "B00858I4M0", "B005FVNGZA", "B005GLFSYQ"], "bought_together": ["B0053T4PHC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CD1PTF0", "B0053T4PHC", "B00D5Q75RC", "B004LTEUDO"]}}
