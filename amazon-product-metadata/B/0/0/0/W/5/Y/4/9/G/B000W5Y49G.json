{"asin": "B000W5Y49G", "description": "The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately", "price": 50.15, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31fnQ%2Bt%2BG9L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002HGE308", "B000X2RKOO", "B001ET07O0", "1101898151", "B000WCQWR6", "B001AWIP7M", "B00117PPME", "B002I08CJG", "B000RF7164", "B000P297F2", "B001TOMR0C", "B0020H46D8", "B00503E9UO", "B000P46NKC", "B004I6KDA4", "B002EE7OKE", "B001SI39E2", "B001BQVXP8", "B003O6H7X0", "B004WLRQMI", "B0024MJ8XC", "B0094X2066", "B003XDRIYC", "B002BSC4ZS", "B0094X1ZXU", "B001LY0QJ4", "B003O6FW6E", "B001TOMQVC", "B0094X28J0", "B003N3HEU0", "B001COVME6", "B0037US4IA", "B002I0GD06", "B001HB7K6I", "B00KWFY04A", "B003P5AJFI", "B00K278J0Y", "B00KWEHBAG", "B002BSC54I", "B004WLRQ2S", "B000G7T7JC", "B003ZHMMEM", "B001HKPUKC", "B001GIUWX0", "B003XLUJ86", "B004L5SJ5I", "B002TLTBN0", "B00KVRK39A", "B000Z9A95M", "B000GPW2QO", "B0013B30SY", "B003WOFXEY", "B002BSA388", "0804161380", "B00K278IWS", "B000FRV2UK", "B000FQBPDU", "B00269DXXO", "B002BRZ9G0", "B000X25GW2", "B0094X227I", "B0019SY1D4", "B0058CA4S8", "B000FQBPCQ", "B00269DXR0", "B0056C2LIG", "B002EE5SAC", "B002E6XY6U", "B0013E9HP6", "B003JD7QYI", "B00KBD4SJA", "1616550414", "B009NRO1J2", "B002BRZ9AG", "B002BRYXOO", "B0017Q4DGI", "B00B2QL2Y4", "B000FQ9R4E", "B001PO2BJI", "B001GHMLLC", "B0002WYUB6", "B001TOQ8UW", "B002HJQSQW", "0804162727", "B001AWFIPO", "B005FYJA52", "B0050OWRBG", "B000TP2UZO", "B006QRNKOO", "B00GGGOO9A", "B00FLYZ7NU", "B00293IKQC", "B00FLYZIM0", "B004FRVDUU", "B000G7PMX2", "B002E0S6K0", "B009AFLXQQ", "B003M31RN6", "B003GB4UXI"], "bought_together": ["B002HGE308"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003WOFXEY", "B0024MJ8XC", "B00117PPME", "B001SI39E2"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 3600}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Wii"]]}
