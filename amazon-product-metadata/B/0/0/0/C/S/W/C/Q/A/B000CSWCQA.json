Weighing in at just over 2.5 ounces, the Garmin Forerunner 305 breaks new ground in terms of comfort, style, and performance. Totally redesigned, the 305 gives outdoor athletes and runners real-time information about speed, distance, pace, and heart rate on a device that's easy to use and amazingly compact.The Forerunner 305 features the powerful new SiRF GPS navigation chip for supreme accuracy, even under tree cover and between tall buildings. A coded chest strap heart-rate monitor prevents unwanted interference from other devices.View larger.The unit's GPS receiver is designed to face towards the sky when you're running.A more watch-like design makes it far easier to use and wear.Plus, the 305 is engineered to help folks train better and smarter. Training assistant tools, various distance and time alerts, and bundled Training Center PC software combine to make the device an essential part of any athlete's training program.The 305's digitally coded heart-rate monitor--which is worn as a chest strap--sends heart-rate data to the device so you can see whether you're training too hard or not hard enough. Alerts for pace, distance, time, and heart rate are also available. Additionally, the unit tracks speed, distance, pace, and calories burned. Meanwhile, a course feature lets you race against previous runs in order to improve your time or just compare heart rate and pace data at every point of the way.The 305's easy-to-read, 1.3-inch display has been integrated into a sleek and stylish form factor that is definitely a step up from the larger and more cumbersome Forerunner 301 model. Indeed, the 305 looks and wears like a stylish sports watch, and it's more carefully designed to meet the needs of athletes. The design also positions the antenna with an optimal view of the sky. As an added feature, the case is water resistant to IEC 60529 IPX7 standards (can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes).Accuracy is the name of the game with the 305. The vastly more accurate GPS antenna and receiver, which uses an advanced SiRF chip, offer much faster satellite acquisition times. Plus, the unit can hold a fix in places never before possible. Gone are the days of losing a fix under tree cover or when running between tall buildings. All of these features add up to far more accuracy in recording and tracking your exercise data. And because the 305 uses GPS to track how far and how fast you're going, you never have to calibrate it. The unit also doubles as a basic navigator. Mark your starting point as a specific location, see your current position on the plotter display, and follow an electronic breadcrumb trail back to your starting point.The 305 features a USB data connection and docking cradle for downloading your speed, lap, exercise time, and heart-rate data into Garmin's Training Center PC software. The unit stores up to 1,000 lap histories, which you can download to your PC for a detailed post-workout analysis. Plus, you can create and schedule workouts using the included software and download them to the unit. A rechargeable internal lithium-ion battery offers up to ten hours of battery life.For additional post-workout analysis, the 305 is compatible with MotionBased software. MotionBased adds a new dimension to training and outdoor fitness that makes the analytical aspects of a sport more compelling and a lot more fun. You can upload data to MotionBased, a Web-based application that has partnered with Garmin. MotionBased provides in-depth analysis of your workouts, as well as online mapping and route sharing that will take your training to the next level. MotionBased automatically calculates time, distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate, and it displays this information through meaningful charts, illustrations, reports, and maps. With MotionBased, you can also race multiple instances of the same route to see how you are improving or to race other members of MotionBased. You can \"virtually race\" someone you don't even know.If you like the features of the Forerunner 305 but don't need heart-rate monitoring, be sure to check out theForerunner 205.What's in the BoxForerunner 305 unit, digital coded heart rate monitor, Training Center CD-ROM, A/C charger, PC/USB interface cable, owner's manual, and quick-start guide.", "title": "Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 281.3, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lHg9ZcN7L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Garmin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VK5BMQ", "B000G687AS", "B000ONDECY", "B000E65HXA", "B00264GKVQ", "B000MM3EKY", "B00AOLFDR0", "B0011UNMIK", "B000BFNOT8", "B0025VKUPM", "B00AVIT638", "B009OEE2ZC", "B0097BEEGE", "B002L140TS"], "bought_together": ["B000VK5BMQ", "B00264GKVQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0025VKUPM", "B000MM3EKY", "B000G687AS", "B0025VKW5K"]}}
