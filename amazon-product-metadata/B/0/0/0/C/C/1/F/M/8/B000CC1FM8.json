{"asin": "B000CC1FM8", "categories": [["Grocery & Gourmet Food"]], "description": "Long before Kerrygold was ever heard of - in fact, as far back as written records go - dairying has played a starring role in Ireland. In the old days, Irishmen kept cattle for milk more than for meat, and status was derived from the bounty of your herd.How did cows become the cornerstone of Irish wealth? Simple. Ireland was made for milk. It has everything you need to make a cow happy: good soil, a mild climate, moisture-bearing southwesterly winds, and all the green grass you can chew.It didn't take long to figure out that happy cows produce amazing milk, which can then be churned into unbeatable butter. As early as the 17th century, Ireland was sharing its butter with the world. Irish boats were being met at the dock by salivating Swedes, Danes, Portuguese, Frenchmen, Spaniards and American colonists - just as Kerrygold butter is today.The butter is so appealingly golden that it looks as though it has been colored, although the color is natural, coming from the beta-carotene in the intense green Irish grass consumed by the cows. Made in the style of all premium European butters, Kerrygold's higher fat content gives its butter a distinctive richness. The foil wrapper preserves freshness and premium quality", "title": "Kerrygold Pure Irish Butter - Salted (8 ounce)", "price": 4.99, "salesRank": {"Grocery & Gourmet Food": 75542}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wkKbjx4gL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LNPHNA", "B0000D9MXU", "B004AOGJPW", "B00443QZ3K", "B0032RPLSY", "B0019LRY8A", "B007N6Z5J0", "B002CXX31G", "B009Q6MLCE", "B0010EGNGK", "B001EL30TM", "B00B7E2D9Y", "B001I7MVG0", "B0046IIPMW", "B002M06SMU", "B000V79VSY", "B00AFB5U3Q", "B000N7DP6G", "B0014APFB4"], "also_viewed": ["B0032RPLSY", "B001LNPHNA", "B007N6Z5J0", "B002CXX31G", "B00443QZ3K", "B00B03ZWOU", "B00CHTWACI", "B0043D42DG", "B00CHTRZA0", "B0050ILPI8", "B0046IIPMW", "B0000D9MXU", "B0019LRY8A", "B00EAOO8SW", "B00GW5DXKG", "B00AN2CB84", "B001LMPF7E", "B00E0WB292", "B00IXYFAZU", "B00K5LHCQE", "B0039OINH6", "B00CLFFV1A", "B00DUFYQYS", "B00D60RUP4", "B0010EGNGK", "B004AOGJPW", "B008EADJO2", "B00I4UXSCK", "B00INQGLVU", "B0043CXZDU", "B009Q6MLCE", "B0082CKFOY", "B004OYXBR2", "B0054S6L6A", "B004OZ2B22", "B001UUVKFS", "B00FE6DDJU", "B008SG9Y4G", "B00E0W3KEC", "B004GP068Q", "B001RBTSMM", "B0046IM3K2", "B004LKDKFC", "B00L4L5TGO", "B00HVOV6SS", "B003R6C3AY", "B00CHTVOKC", "B0006Q9568", "B0027Z8VES", "B00LIEB3IA", "B000MT3VHS", "B0011EFBYY", "B0000TU6PA"], "bought_together": ["B001LNPHNA", "B0019LRY8A"]}}
