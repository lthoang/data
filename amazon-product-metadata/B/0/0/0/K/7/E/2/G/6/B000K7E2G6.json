This straightener reaches a top heat of 430 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds for fast, long-lasting results. An LCD display with temperature lock makes for precise temperature adjustments.Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat IronAt a Glance:Ceramic Fabric-wrapped plates for 50% less hair splitting and damageEasy-to-read LCD indicator display with temperature lock for precise adjustments300-430-degree heat range for fast and long-lasting resultsHeats up in 30 seconds; auto-shutoff in 60 minutes4-year warrantyMade with ceramic fabric, the Damage Therapy has a non-stick, low-friction surface.View larger.Heats to a maximum of 430 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds.View larger.Remington's Therapy CollectionThe Remington Style Therapy collection--a hair care system that delivers conditioning properties while styling--provides solutions to combat irritating hair problems and works to increase hair health and vibrancy.
