HANC80 offers both \"wide\" and \"low\" noise cancellation modes. The \"wide\" mode targets a wider frequency range than the \"low\" mode, and cancels the type of noise typically found in a commercial jet cabin. The \"low\" mode cancels a slightly narrower and lower frequency range, one associated with the noise generated by trains and buses. The HANC80 deliver up to 75% noise reduction, and also comes with fully padded closed earpieces which help to block ambient noise, and the padded soft touch headband ensure that they'll remain comfortable throughout a long listening. It also offers a flat foldable style so that they're easy to carry or pack, and comes with a carrying pouch and a dual-plug adapter.", "title": "JVC HANC80 Noise-Cancelling Headphones - Black", "price": 40.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4196OMdrvfL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "JVC", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067RC4", "B000U07C1U", "B002I9WCWK", "B00083LFW6", "B001EYU3L2", "B009A6CZ3A", "B002XKHLW0", "B003N7NN06", "B005DWU0VO", "B0046W83A2"], "bought_together": ["B000067RC4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000U07C1U", "B001EYU3L2", "B00BSXRBGE", "B007SY4QTW"]}}
