Say goodbye to looking for ways to stabilize your handheld shots or to get that unique perspective--now you can be free to shoot however you like!Durable and innovative, the Gorillapod weighs just 8.5 ounces, or 241 grams, and can support cameras--such as DSLRs with zoom lensea and video cameras--weighing up to 6.6 pounds, or 3 kilograms. Measuring just 9.8 inches in length, the Gorillapod fits easily into a purse, backpack, or even a roomy jacket pocket."}
