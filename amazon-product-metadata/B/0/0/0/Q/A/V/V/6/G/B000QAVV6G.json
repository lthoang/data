When a power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply he sparks an invasion that turns the country into a war zone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new co-op multiplayer mode.  And remember rule #1 for mercenaries: EVERYBODY PAYS.Left ColumnLogo Image (Assumes a logo of 200ppx)Center ColumnKey FeaturesMassively Open World- Play throughout the varied terrains of Venezuela that is larger than all theMercenariesmaps combined.Work for the Highest Bidder- You decide which factions to work for and when.
