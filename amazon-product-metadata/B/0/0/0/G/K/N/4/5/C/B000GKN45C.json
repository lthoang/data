Designed to fit a two-inch receiver hitch, the bike rack makes it easy to load and unload your bikes from ground level. The rack includes a set of fast-adjustable, quick-release tire hoops and a ratcheting top arm, helping it fit a wide range of bike frames. In addition, the rack's center arm folds down when not in use, making it easy to access the rear of the vehicle without removing the rack. And to ensure that your rack doesn't rust over time, the XC-4 is powder coated. Built to provide more ground clearance than other racks, the cross-country rack comes with new and improved wheel straps for bicycle security."}
