{"asin": "B0009UBR3A", "description": "Despite all the hoopla surrounding the next generation consoles, the most anticipated gaming event of this year is undoubtedly the latestThe Legend of Zeldagame. SubtitledTwilight Princess, the game looks radically different fromThe Wind Wakerwith less stylized, more realistic looking graphics.As ever with a Nintendo title, much of the game is still surrounded in secrecy, but previews have already shown the game's enormous scale with huge areas of rolling countryside for you to ride your horse and battle various evil enemies. Indeed, the game seems more action-focused than previous adventures, both on horseback and on foot.One major new feature revealed in the game is that Link is now able to transform into a wolf. This gives him a whole suite of new features including the ability to \"see\" smells and access areas impossible as a human (or elf).Despite the greater emphasis on action, the puzzles in the game are even more elaborate than before. A forest dungeon reveals your ability to communicate with animals. You order around a troupe of baboons to solve puzzles and to help battle the level boss.The GameCube could hardly have asked for any better swansong than this, with utterly amazing graphics and an apparently endless range of features and settings. Even with so little still known about it, this is still on course to be the best game of the year.-- Harrison Dent, Amazon.co.ukThis preview is based on an incomplete version of the game; features or problems mentioned above may not appear in the finished game.", "price": 124.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51I25VxTAfL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000084318", "B004CHLNWQ", "B0009XSMNA", "0761555722", "B00012D0SG", "B000066JRN", "B00006IJJK", "B0002ILS1U", "B00005QEFD", "B00005Q8M0", "B0002ILS1K", "B000L9NPGG", "B0001YYNL2", "B00009PS24", "B000ARPXU0", "B000620PSY", "B00009WAUD", "B00008KTWH", "9861019731", "B0000657SP", "B0000A09EN", "B00005Q8LR", "B00005Q8M4", "B00005QDPZ", "B00005QEFF", "B000AQA9UA", "B00008H2IS", "B00006IJJI", "B00095KU5G", "B00006599U", "B00006FWTX", "B0017KIBAI", "B0000E5U6I", "B0002ILS24", "B002BSC54I", "B002L8W5V6", "B00030GS80", "B00006LELI", "B0002A6CQ4", "B00009WAUH", "B000A15K0Y", "B00009KO3S", "B00005Q8LY", "B00006HBTW", "B0002CHIWO", "B000FRV2UK", "B002L93F0A", "B0002A6CPK", "B0001OK7VW", "B0000A0O28", "B0000E5U6K", "B000AOEU2K", "B00021HBAE", "1616550414", "B00005BOSF", "7100027950", "B000067K2D", "B006QRNKOO", "B000A28ENI", "B00006LEMY", "B00005ATSN", "B000069BB0", "B001AI7CF2", "B0000A1OG4", "B000B8J7JQ", "B00004U1R1", "B0000D9SQ6", "B000070IWB", "B00009WAUF", "B0000A30RA", "B0009XEC0M", "B00004U1R2", "B0000VSH4U", "B00KWEHBAG", "B0009JB3J4", "B003O6E800", "B0001B167O", "B00006JN5O", "B0009350BM", "B002ATY7JE", "B00006LELB", "B00002SVFV", "B00433XWFU", "B002C5BMFI", "1930206054", "B00007KQC4", "B001TOQ8UW", "B00170UDHM", "B000JVM256", "B00000IWYT", "B00005V3EX", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000067QW2", "B000G75AMK", "B00006AVB1", "B000090W86", "B000FQBPCQ", "B00007KUUD"], "bought_together": ["B000084318", "B00012D0SG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FQBPCQ", "B004WLRQMI", "B000084318", "B004CHLNWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2240}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube"]]}
