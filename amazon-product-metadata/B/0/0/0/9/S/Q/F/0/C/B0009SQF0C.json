{"asin": "B0009SQF0C", "description": "For far too long, the bullies of Bullworth Academy have been stealing lunch money and making life miserable for students. For far too long, you've taken a back seat as nerds were taunted and put on display. And for far too long nobody has put the bullies in their place. Finally, the time for sweet revenge is here! The Rockstar tradition of groundbreaking, original gameplay and humorous tongue-in-cheek storytelling invades an entirely new setting: the schoolyard. As a mischievous schoolboy, you'll stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the worst school around, Bullworth Academy - a corrupt and crumbling prep school with an uptight facade.The joy of cliques.View larger.Payback comes at the most unlikely times.View larger.Don't put anything past the brilliant nerds.View larger.Preppie or jock, which will you choose?.View larger.Life at the academyThe story follows Jimmy Hopkins, a teenager who's been expelled from every school he's ever attended. Left to fend for himself after his mother abandons him at Bullworth to go on her fifth honeymoon, Jimmy has a whole year at Bullworth ahead of him, working his way up the social ladder of this demented institution of supposed learning, standing up for what he thinks is right and taking on the liars, cheats and snobs who are the most popular members of the student body and faculty. If Jimmy can survive the school year and outsmart his rivals, he could rule the school.Using the \"living sandbox\" game style similar to Rockstar's previous titles, players complete goals and experiment with items in the game world. A rival may dare you to drop a firecracker into a toilet or scare some sense into the kid who took your lunch money. Don't spend too much time roaming the halls, however, as you may actually be punished for skipping out on important classes. Choices you make outside of school will also impact how friends and foes in the school view you after you buy new clothes and sport a new haircut.Mini games aboundBullworth Academy pride themselves in rigidly sticking to the curriculum at all times, to this end consistent truancy will result in punishment. The esteemed staff of the Academy, though occasionally questionable in their recreational habits, ensure that the pupils have a firm grounding in the key academic subjects. Alongside the strict principals of loyalty, trust and ruthless ambition that are ingrained in every pupil in the academy by the principal Dr Crabblesnitch, core subjects include English, Gym, Shop Class, Photography, Art and Chemistry. Each subject comprises a series of five tests to be passed with flying colors. Of course on passing each test a due reward, in the form of gameplay features will be earned by the player. Bullworth Academy's educational system is provided through a host of exciting and innovative mini games lovingly developed by Rockstar Vancouver to accompany the main storyline of Bully.Do a double cliqueJust like any other crumbling prep school, Bullworth Academy has its cliques. You'll have to choose whether to side with football jocks, well-dressed preppies, or try to turn them against each other while you laugh at the antics with your fellow greasers. Clique membership becomes even more exciting as your clique rises to the head of the class- making a name for themselves and striking fear into the hearts of those who might cross you. Don't be surprised if some cliques offer up some surprises, as those bug-eyed nerds just may have the scientific know how to create weaponry that can keep those bullies at bay.Ready yourself for a hilarious return to campus living with Bully, the outrageously funny debut title from Rockstar Vancouver, available exclusively for PlayStation2 computer entertainment system.", "price": 39.82, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSWCJ9PNL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A8VBZ", "B0001ADAME", "B0001VGFK2", "B000930DLO", "B00097CYZS", "B0002XL3BA", "B000B69E9G", "B0001AVZ5I", "B000EHQDA0", "B000KCX9M4", "B0009I6S0O", "B0007PLKZM", "B0000ARQMW", "B000095ZH5", "B0009Z3HYW", "B00009ZVHY", "B000QB059Y", "B000FW4YOQ", "B000NGWFX6", "B000F0GX8I", "B000TLU67W", "B0002Y2XXQ", "B00005OLX1", "B000G6SPHI", "B00008DHNL", "B00004YRQ9", "B0009O7HVM", "B000GDJJP8", "B0009Z3HMY", "B0009Z3HXI", "B0000696CZ", "B001CLG6SG", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00005ME6N", "B0009351R0", "B00005TNI6", "B001MW91IW", "9629971372", "B000EMJA3M", "B000GPVUQ2", "B0002CNUN0", "B0009350BW", "B00004YRQA", "B0013KW1B2", "B00020LZAW", "B0000B0MNH", "B000NIJ35W", "B0000A082Y", "B00005O0I2", "B0000C7GHG", "B00005J536", "B0033T1UWW", "B00004YUWA", "B0009A4EVM", "B00005CF9L", "B000066TS5", "B00006JN5H", "B0006ZJPR8", "B000GQ1FVG", "B0000A0MDV", "B0002IQC8E", "B0000690ZE", "B00020LZBG", "B0032GTMEE", "B0009PETYO", "B000E991PC", "B000IONGU4", "B00006GSO0", "B0002IQD3I", "B0000A92KX", "B00009ZVHW", "B00005NN5G", "B000935256", "B0008GJRRS", "B00008H2IW", "B0009N1KCU", "B000F5IH2I", "B0002CHJ8C", "B0002IQCSY", "B00005NCCR", "B00009WAVI", "B00006IJJE", "B00006GSNX", "B00026RFI2", "B00005NN5A", "B0013JHKU0", "B00005ME6O", "B001MW3TS0", "B003P9LECG", "B000HAUODG", "B0002B90OE", "B000AOEUPC", "B0007OGDIC", "B00020BV2E", "B0009PKDOY", "B0002RQ3I4", "B00005V6BP", "B00009WAVB", "B0009VRSIC", "B000F3AACA"], "bought_together": ["B0001VGFK2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MW91IW", "B000KCX9M4", "B0001VGFK2", "B0001ADAME"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2923}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
