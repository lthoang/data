{"asin": "B00099C2M6", "description": "The Tokina AT-X 124 AF PRO DX lens is Tokina's first lens designed with an APS-C sized sensor. This lens gives the Digital Photographer an ultra wide-angle zoom lens that has the equivalent of an 18-36mm zoom range on a 35mm film camera while maintaining a bright constant aperture of f/4. Non-rotating 77mm filter threads mean special effect filters will not change when the lens' focus is changed. Fast internal focusing with Tokina's One-Touch focus clutch mechanism allows the lens to AF focus faster and switching between auto and manual focus is as easy as snapping the focus ring back and forth. 2 sharp-cut aspherical elements accurately correct aspherical aberration usually associated with ultra-wide angle lenses. Bright, constant f/4 aperture allows plenty of light to enter the camera for shooting in a wide variety of photographic situations. A chrome-plated brass mount plate and all-metal zoom unit can stand up to regular use, while an advanced polycarbonate outer lens barrel reduces the weight of the lens, making it a pleasure to carry.  Dimensions -  3.3 x 3.5 (84x89.5mm)   Weight -  20.1 ounces (570 grams)", "title": "Tokina 12mm - 24mm F/4 PRO DX Autofocus Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras", "price": 513.69, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BdltqBsjL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004ZCJM", "B00009R9EO", "B00004ZCI3", "B0042X9LC4", "B0095ZKUD8", "B002JCSV6M", "B001LMQM4O", "B00005LEN4", "B007SXJ26A", "B005C50H2Y", "B00004ZCJG", "B00603RTC8", "B001S2PPT0", "B0042X9L6A", "B001UE6N8S", "B000HJPK2C", "B00508ZURU", "B005DIYQA4", "B000O161X0", "B00004ZCJJ", "B003ZSHNCC", "B0016QDHCK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007ORX8ME", "B00004ZCJM", "B00BTXAZ4I", "B00004ZCI3"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses", "Camera Lenses", "Digital Camera Lenses"]]}
