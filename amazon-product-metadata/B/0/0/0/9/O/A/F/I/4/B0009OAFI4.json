Further, the lens features an angle of view from 31.5 degrees to 8.1 degrees (equivalent in focal length from 76.5mm to 306mm in the 35mm format).The lens also incorporates an Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass lens element (11-element/10-group optical construction) and two aspherical lens elements for true-to-life image reproduction and overall size reduction. The image circle in DA-series lenses is designed to perfectly match the 23.5mm x 15.7mm size of the CCD used in Pentax digital SLRs to optimize camera performance. The new design also contributes to a drastic reduction in size, weight and production cost, compared to 35mm-format counterparts with similar specifications.Other features include:Compact dimensions with minimal aberrationsResponsive Quick-Shift Focus System allows instant shift from AF to MFComes with a lens hood to minimize flare and ghost images52mm filter sizeWeighs 9.2 ouncesMeasures 2.6 x 3.1 inches (diameter x length)", "title": "Pentax DA 50-200mm f/4-5.6 ED Lens for Pentax and Samsung DSLR Cameras", "price": 243.39, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41g3vlKE3bL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Pentax", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040RDT0M", "B0043M6F14", "B00061J2BQ", "B007OXY8H2", "B00AAQXGLE", "B002BSGUZ8", "B003G5A2RW", "B00004ZCJG", "B003Y2WUIQ", "B004UR7250", "B00861DI4U", "B00DBPKAAG", "B0052Z9HZ2", "B0028N7442", "B002MR84UC", "B005KK41UA", "B00DX5D9I4", "B00005ABCQ", "B0012QE4DK", "B004N6WDRU", "B00B8ZKN2Q", "B003FHZ3OS"], "bought_together": ["B00004ZCJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BSGUZI", "B0040RDT0M", "B00004ZCJF", "B004FRYIMA"]}}
