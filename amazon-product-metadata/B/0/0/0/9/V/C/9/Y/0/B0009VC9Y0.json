Kershaw's flawless assisted opening system, SpeedSafe, assists the user to smoothly open the knife with a manual push on the blade's thumb stud or index-open system. In order to open the knife, the user must apply manual pressure to the thumb stud to overcome the resistance of the torsion bar. After the blade is out of the handle, the torsion bar moves along its track and takes over. The blade opens smoothly and locks into position, ready for use. Measuring four inches long when closed and weighing just 3.1 ounces, this versatile knife includes a limited lifetime warranty.Manufacturer WarrantyLimited lifetime warrantyAbout Kershaw KnivesSince the company's founding in 1974, Kershaw Knives has been dedicated to quality that has led to a worldwide reputation for performance and innovation in tools and knives.
