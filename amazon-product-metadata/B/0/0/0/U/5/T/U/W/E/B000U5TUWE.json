Using the physics of weight distribution along with high tech anti-skid materials, it creates a solid mounting base to turn your windshield-mounted GPS into a dash-mounted GPS.The Nav-Mat conforms to the contours of your dashboard, allowing it to work on uneven or textured surfaces while the anti-skid underside keeps the device from sliding. Designed to work with devices up to several pounds using the stock windshield suction mount sold with most popular GPS units, the Nav-Mat requires no tools for installation and can easily be moved from vehicle to vehicle or put out of sight when leaving the vehicle.Also works well with other Bracketron Windshield Mounts for mounting devices such as Satellite Radio, Cell Phones and MP3 Players.What's in the BoxBracketron UFM-100BL Nav-Mat GPS Friction Dash Pad, User's Manual", "title": "Bracketron UFM-100BL Nav-Mat GPS Friction Dash Pad", "price": 15.2, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513fCZR223L._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Bracketron", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008P8FC4I", "B006ZOI9YY", "B006ZOIAN4", "B00DI4CZJ4", "B001B663TE", "B001EPX7N2", "B00L2R2CPQ", "B005441DVM", "B0031B7DCS", "B0042FZ6YY", "B007FHX9OK", "B00F0CXAF0", "B006ZOI9OY", "B002IKKFJ6", "B0051FWA7U", "B007FH716W", "B00BR3Q9TK", "B002OL2MU4", "B00CZ6WFXM", "B00CRQUKQ4", "B005MQ3M52", "B000EDQR4Q", "B007IVZX6K", "B00178RDZ4", "B00DGNZFHG", "B001BP42GG", "B0002HBOMO", "B000EDQR46", "B000BUQOGI", "B00DGNZG8Y", "B000X6HXLA", "B005DIBHCE", "B004I5BUSO", "B000BGK22E", "B0099RGRT8", "B001ET5O70", "B004V3KCIM", "B003AL23TC", "B001IB2120", "B00192JFD6", "B002XM592M", "B0024ECIP0", "B00BXQ0370", "B00DW954UC", "B007RMAS1K", "B001H4B0AC", "0984692126", "B0057OCDQS", "B0012GTVVA", "B001FCAXT0", "B00CB6X6Y8", "B001BZM998", "B007M4Z7GO", "B0016LE80K", "B0082XN57W", "B005DIBHA6", "B001FC79EW", "B0006IX87S", "0762793015", "B001DAT0XE", "B00AXX0IC4"], "bought_together": ["B007FHX9OK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EPX7N2", "B002OL2MU4", "B001B663TE", "B0051FWA7U"]}}
