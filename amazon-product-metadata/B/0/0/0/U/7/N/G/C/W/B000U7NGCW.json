Each model can be entirely pivoted towards the listener while remaining discretely recessed behind a flush-mounted grille. If listening position or tastes change, the speaker can be easily aimed in another direction with a simple push of the hand. SpeakerCraft innovation, excellence in engineering, and American made quality make the AIM series one of the most exceptional loudspeakers ever."}
