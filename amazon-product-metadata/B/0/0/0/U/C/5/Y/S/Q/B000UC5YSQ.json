{"asin": "B000UC5YSQ", "description": "Sigma's 18-50mm EX series macro lens is specially designed for Nikon digital SLR cameras with a minimum focusing distance of 20 cm (7.9 inches), making it suitable for a wide variety of subjects. The lens offers a large aperture of F2.8 throughout the entire zoom range, along with a maximum magnification of 1:3 for close-up macro photography. The interior, meanwhile, incorporates both glass-mold and hybrid aspherical lens technology to deliver superior peripheral brightness and extremely high image quality. Add in Special Low Dispersion (SLD) and Extraordinary Low Dispersion (ESD) glass elements and you have a lens that can correct all types of color aberrations while providing a high level of optical performance at every interval.The lens also offers a super multilayer lens coating that reduces flare and ghosting, a common problem among many digital cameras. Users will also appreciate the inner focusing system, which provides a fast autofocus speed while preventing the front of the lens from rotating, making it particularly suitable for use with circular polarizing filters and the petal-shaped lens hood (included). The Sigma 18-50mm lens--which measures 3.1 inches in diameter and 3.4 inches long--weighs only 15.9 ounces and carries a one-year warranty.", "title": "Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC HSM Macro Lens for Nikon DSLR", "price": 499.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511bxYhDWdL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003A6NU3U", "B002332KC8", "B00AXZZ034", "B000JDJJ82", "B00156OZ68", "B002LVUIXU", "B002ZNJB2S", "B003A6H27K", "B000144I2Q", "B000EXV0QQ", "B001955P8W", "B001PGXEGA", "B002ZNJB32", "B00DBL09FG", "B0007U0H06", "B0013A1XDE", "B005SC9FU6", "B00021EE4U", "B0002P19Q2", "B002LVUIXA", "B000FZ3FY8", "B00AXZYY86", "B001NEK2QO", "B007SRLJCQ", "B00005LE74", "B008B4893M", "B0015U95SW", "B000EXR0SI", "B005C50H2Y", "B002D2VSD6", "B000HJPK0Y", "B000UC26CS", "B00099C2M6", "B0007U00XK", "B000GPKQHQ", "B003HC8VA4", "B00BQXL8FG", "B007ORX8ME", "B00005LEOH", "B00005RKSL", "B000CMNL52", "B006IQ3W0U", "B0018ZDGAW", "B001S2PPT0", "B00HQ4W4PC", "B001EO6W8K", "B008B14TQ6", "B004HD577M", "B0007U0GZM", "B0012X61U2", "B004Y1AYAC", "B001DYC0CS", "B000ZMCILW", "B0012GDOQS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003A6NU3U", "B002332KC8", "B0000BZLBQ", "B00004ZCJJ"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses", "Camera Lenses", "Digital Camera Lenses"]]}
