Macro lenses can uncover detail that would be impossible to detect by the eye and give new perspective to extremely minute subjects such as insects or the petals of a small flower, and this lens is no exception. The 60mm lens offers an angle of view that's equivalent to a 96mm lens on a 35mm camera, along with a floating optical system that can focus down to life-size 1:1 magnification. The inner focusing system, meanwhile, is driven by a silent and powerful ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM), meaning the lens's overall length never changes during focus. Ultimately, the multi-purpose lens is equally at home shooting macro shots, portraits, or available-light photos. Like all Canon EF-S lenses, this lens is restricted to the EOS 20D, EOS Digital Rebel, and EOS Digital Rebel XT cameras.Focal length: 60mmMaximum aperture: 1:2.8Lens construction: 12 elements in 8 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 25 degreesFocus adjustment: ManualClosest focusing distance: 0.65 feetFilter size: 52mmDimensions: 2.9 inches in diameter, 2.8 inches longWeight: 11.8 ounces"}
