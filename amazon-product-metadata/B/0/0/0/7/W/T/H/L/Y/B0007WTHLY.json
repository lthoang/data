{"asin": "B0007WTHLY", "description": "From the Manufacturer The Etymotic Research ER-6 Isolator is a compact, earbud-style set of earphones that are ideal for travel and personal listening. If you've ever been a skeptic of earbud sound quality, the ER-6 will shatter the headphone myth that bigger is better.The ER-6 features a noise isolation of 34-36 dB that far surpasses that of active noise-canceling earphones. This makes the ER-6 a perfect choice for travelers, because these earphones will actively cancel the white noise caused by traffic, trains, or airplanes. These tiny earbuds are perfect for CD, DVD, and MP3 players, as well as laptop computers. Plus, the ER-6 is designed to plug directly into most airline audio systems, so you'll never have to pay for those cheap, airline headphones again.", "title": "Etymotic Research ER6 Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 59.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21la2BC0zdL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003S3RFIQ", "B000XPG2QI", "B000BFVI28", "B000XP8DJC", "B004CXBJ6A", "B007TCXGVC", "B007TCXI24", "B003S3RFJ0", "B003YTPP72", "B000300Y9O", "B0007WZLDC", "B004PNZFZ8", "B007TCXI06", "B003S3RFJK", "B003S3RFJA", "B007TCXGVW", "B0078JXDQ4", "B0012OP7HE", "B00426DND4", "B003YTROIU", "B002LWOKJ2", "B001I44LSY", "B002KQ5MAK", "B00ELAM8LE", "B001TDKMLE", "B00GB1M49M", "B007TCXGXK", "B00573S3RC", "B006WT2AD8", "B005TOV0OM", "B00IHUNLT2", "B005AUTSOY", "B000WAHFBK", "B00EXN4GK0", "B002QL3CX8", "B0078JXDRI", "B0013JT3XC", "B00A16BT4E", "B00373PE9Y", "B00ELAM8NC", "B0019RBJOE", "B000NIOVWC", "B001V9LPT4", "B003YTTN9I", "B00EWOK09G", "B005W1DSU6", "B004P7O26W", "B006KESOYY", "B004N80E9C", "B0081YU6YW", "B008X9Q0JK", "B00591GIMY", "B001MBLBXQ", "B004LX8Y0U", "B006K556B2", "B00ATWLG8Y", "B0050L5VO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003S3RFIQ", "B000XPG2QI", "B004PNZFZ8", "B000BFVI28"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Headphones"]]}
