With an SRS surround sound mode that can be switched on or off, and a design that completely encases your ears, the RS 130s are ideal for kicking back on the couch with a DVD when the rest of the house is asleep. Or, maybe you want to dance to the music from your hi-fi system while doing some laundry. With the RS 130s you can move around freely while enjoying audiophile-class sound wherever you roam.While many wireless headphones suffer from poor reception, the RS 130s have the problem licked with intelligent auto tuning and a self-learning automatic signal level control that provides maximum signal reception and a range of up to 150 meters. The headphones are lightweight, too, making them very comfortable to wear. The included transmitter and stand makes recharging the headphone batteries easy; simply hang the headphones on the charging cradle and you're good to go. With an operating time of approximately 22 hours, though, plan on spending most of your time enjoying rich sound and maximum mobility.What's in the BoxRS 130 headphones, rechargeable NiMH battery pack, transmitter and recharging stand, AC adapter, user's manual.", "title": "Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones", "price": 189.99, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tiDtlwj4L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V6FX9G", "B00GYCZ47M", "B000EBPJCO", "B002TLT10S", "B002TLT10I", "B002SOU2Y0", "B0001FTVEK"], "bought_together": ["B000V6FX9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FTVEK", "B002TLT10I", "B002SOU2Y0", "B002TLT10S"]}}
