{"asin": "B00075OSBK", "description": "This product is packaged and shipped with extra protection to help protect your investment. The patented SPIRALCELL Technology in Optima RedTop batteries is truly worthy of praise. Optima RedTop batteries are built to withstand the abuse from Trucks, SUVs and 4WD experience on and off-road. SPIRALCELL Technology immobilizes the internal components of the battery, enabling Optima batteries to withstand incredible amounts of vibration. Vehicles modified for better engine performance demand more from a battery. Optima batteries withstand the high underhood temperatures associated with these Performance vehicles. This prevents external gassing and leaking which can damage engine components and limit battery performance. An Optima RedTop battery is the only battery specifically designed to take abuse. Its patented SPIRALCELL Technology offers 15 times the vibration resistance and up to twice the life of ordinary batteries. Plus it's spill-proof, highly resistant to heat and cold, and can be stored for long periods without maintenance. Optima batteries deliver a higher level of power to the starter in the critical first 10 seconds of the vehicle starting cycle. This decreased internal resistance, along with the completely sealed case, is the key to Optima's unparalleled high power delivery, increased cycle life and fast recharge capability for fast recovery in short driving cycles. Optima's unique SPIRALCELL design offers the greatest technology in providing a strong and clean power source that far surpasses any of today's filled lead/acid batteries.", "title": "Optima 8022-091-FFP RedTop Group 75/25 Starting Battery", "price": 143.36, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LkvILxJmL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CO7DIQ", "B001N72FES", "B000CQFWRS", "B006QH56E6", "B006QH55WY", "B006QH552E", "B000HTPMFC", "B006QH6XQG", "B006QH54VQ", "B0060YHLHU", "B006K8V7KS", "B006QH560A", "B004LR5K30", "B001N729FS", "B006QH550Q", "B006VU5WX8", "B0029QI7KI", "B000CITK8S", "B001DRG57Q", "B000CQFWLY", "B000C427MI", "B0000AXTUY", "B000CQFS0O", "B00062YKAI", "B0060YHP3A", "B00E16LTTK", "B000E43A1S", "B002PCU1U0", "B000C55YN6", "B000C9JQVS", "B00068XCQU", "B006QH55YW", "B000K8IZCM", "B002LWL3XI", "B006QH561E", "B006PTMW8I", "B009X1XDZG", "B000K1LZ76", "B00CGFPW64", "B00AYLA5UU", "B000K8IZ3Q", "B000BZJ9Q0", "B00A1A6PT4", "B0002UEN1U", "B000BZEHZ8"], "also_viewed": ["B006QH552E", "B006QH6XQG", "B006QH560A", "B006QH55WY", "B006QH54VQ", "B006QH56E6", "B006QH550Q", "B0054812K0", "B006QH561E", "B006QH56GE", "B003HIMNPW", "B00AAVMUPW", "B006QH55YW", "B00E16M1L0", "B0002ILK6I", "B003TTTQW2", "B00249CSS2", "B00E16LTTK", "B00AARDNA2", "B0002ILK7M", "B00IG4423S", "B000CO7DIQ", "B00AAX3KXG", "B0002ILK72", "B00249GW9S", "B00FRT9D2A", "B006QH55YM", "B000CQFWRS", "B00GZEJDLW", "B00E16LTSQ", "B00E16M1P6", "B00E16LVYI", "B006QH54WU", "B009M3PQFA", "B0045G8KBQ", "B0002ZR6AU", "B00C5SW2H4", "B003HIUF84", "B004SRTN3Q", "B002496GK8", "B00DHGPVKI", "B00249CRMY", "B000XEF3DM", "B00E16M1S8", "B002496H4S", "B00E16LUSK", "B0026PI2FM", "B00E16LU7Q", "B001N72FES", "B005GVT6V2", "B003TPYS0Q", "B008QDHD3K", "B0038N1VD6", "B000SBTSRC", "B00EUFCHR0", "B003TQ2J3S", "B003E21AG4", "B004MLZURG", "B00249CQUM"], "bought_together": ["B000CO7DIQ", "B001N72FES"]}, "categories": [["Automotive", "Performance Parts & Accessories", "Batteries & Accessories", "Battery Accessories"]]}
