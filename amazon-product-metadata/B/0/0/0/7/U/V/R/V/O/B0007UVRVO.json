With a bi-directional technique, this cable makes the communication completely from USB port to parallel port or completely from parallel port to USB port. The model also makes the communication work with both a PC and a Macintosh. This USB-to-parallel printer cable is typically used to connect a printer to a USB port on a PC. It connects a desktop or laptop computer with on-board USB to a parallel interface printer.By using this USB-to-parallel interface converter cable, you can connect any standard parallel printer to a USB port. The USB interface provides a much faster data transfer rate than a standard parallel port, thereby reducing the time waiting for a print job to be sent to your printer. This portable device is self powered and provides plug-and-play installation to any USB-compliant computer running Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, or a Mac running OS 9.2 or higher. It includes a 6-foot USB-to-parallel adapter cable .What's in the BoxUSB-to-parallel cable."}
