During the system's initial use, the heat from the CPU lowers the viscosity of the compound to enhance the filling of the microscopic valleys and ensure a minimum bond line between the heatsink and the CPU core. Then the compound thickens slightly over the next 100 to 300 hours of use to its final consistency designed for long-term stability. (This should not be confused with conventional phase change pads that are pre-attached to many heatsinks. Those pads melt each time they get hot then re-solidify when they cool. The viscosity changes that Ceramique goes through are much more subtle and ultimately much more effective.) * Excellent Stability: Ceramique is engineered to not separate, run, migrate, or bleed. * Electrical Insulator: Ceramique does not contain any metal or other electrically conductive materials. It is a pure electrical insulator, neither electrically conductive nor capacitive. * Performance: 2 to 10 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core. Easy Clean Up: Ceramique can easily be cleaned from CPUs and heatsinks with isopropyl alcohol or any of the cleaners listed in the product instructions. * Innovative Dispenser: The 2.5-gram Ceramique is the first product available in our proprietary thermal compound syringe. Our new syringe is more compact, easier to handle and dispenses a higher percentage of its content than standard industrial or medical syringes. The amount of compound remaining in the syringe is easy to determine as the rear of the plunger is perfectly flush with the flange when the syringe is empty."}
