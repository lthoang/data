{"asin": "B000ZSUQ9M", "description": "This Gilsson portable beanbag mount is a great base mount for your GPS, MP3 Player, smart phone, or most any portable electronic device. Weighing about two pounds, it's just heavy enough to make sure your electronic device stays put, even with sudden or abrupt maneuvering. It's an ideal choice for drivers in states where the use of windshield suction cup mounts is illegal, and for those who prefer a mount that can quickly be moved out of the way. It won't leave any ugly adhesive residues on your dashboard, and allows you to hide the GPS from thieves when exiting your vehicle.Note: this beanbag mount requires the use of a fixed marine, dashboard or suction cup pedestal, which is secured to the the detachable plate on the beanbag mount base.Works like a charm with Garmin, Magellan, Mio, TomTom, Mio, Lowrance, Motorola, Apple iPod, iPhone, Blackberry, Cell Phone, MP3 or other portable electronics devices.What's in the BoxGilsson UBM Portable Car Non-Skid Friction Beanbag Dashboard Mount, User's Manual", "title": "Gilsson UBM Portable Car Non-Skid Friction Beanbag Dashboard Mount for Garmin, TomTom, Magellan and more", "price": 6.15, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XXTkGVE8L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B002OL2MU4", "B008IOQ3K6", "B000LRMS66", "B00CRQUKQ4", "B002MGANJS", "B007PSPQ7W", "B00AXX0I88"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EPX7N2", "B0051FWA7U", "B002OL2MU4", "B000U5TUWE"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "GPS & Navigation", "GPS System Accessories", "Vehicle Mounts"]]}
