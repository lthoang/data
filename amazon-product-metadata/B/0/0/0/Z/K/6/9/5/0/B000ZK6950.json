With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.", "price": 14.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oVHy80Q%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0050SY4DG", "B004UDLRMS", "B00B59L9VO", "B002I0H79C", "B0022TNO7S", "B000FRU1UM", "B0085CA8NY", "B0023CBY4E", "B004PAGJOC", "B000P297E8", "B003O6G47U", "B000FRS9II", "B000ZK9QD2", "B00309U0M6", "B00149MEWI", "B000TI836G", "B005C2D2MO", "B004FSE52C", "B000FRU0NU", "B0050SWVIQ", "B000F3AADE", "B001A4MTGS", "B002DC8GEK", "B000QY9C90", "B000P46NMK", "B0050SYX8W", "B001D7T2VM", "B004ML7WOK", "B003GSZ9ZE", "B005EZ5GNW", "B0050SYCJM", "B003O6G5TW", "B003C1I0CO", "B000X1PE16", "B003S2MXRA", "B000UU3SVI", "B002I0HBZW", "B000SQ5LQ4", "B0050SYV70", "B000GPVUOY", "B002I0K50U", "B002I0JGDM", "B005VBVQAG", "B0016BVYA2", "B000FRVAD4", "B001HWB68K", "B0016B28Y8", "B00886WO5W", "B007WQOIGW", "B002I0JA7E", "B006ZTHGCK", "B000P46NKC", "B002SRSQ72", "B002BRZ852", "B0044TD9HY", "B0050SY9WC", "B001REZLY8", "B000ZK696O", "B00354NAYG", "B001SH7YMG", "B003ZSP0WW", "B0017ZDGWG", "B0050SYLRK", "B001TOQ8J8", "B002DC8GMM", "B0025KZV7A", "B000WMEEB2", "B003DNH95K", "B003O6N266", "B004FUL9YW", "B002DC8GKE", "B000HX1P72", "B000G7PMXC", "B002BSA20M", "B007UM59AC", "B002BRZ8FW", "B001NX4DUQ", "B00EVWZHLK", "B008XMSRKC", "B001UWGDC6", "B003H0CC2O", "B007V2LMAM", "B003O6EBRA", "B0088MVODE", "B007YZ5QQM", "B0037LTTRO", "B0045EI7I4", "B001AWIP68", "B000H94PVO", "B003P9C6QY", "B000R0URCE", "B0050SY77E", "B0050SYK44", "B003O6EB70", "B002EE5ROO", "B004HYK956", "B000B6ML0U", "B003L8HQ7S", "B001CMIUYS", "B001L18RIE"], "bought_together": ["B0050SY4DG", "B004UDLRMS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050SY4DG", "B002Z7BE1U", "B00B59L9VO", "B000FRU1UM"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1618}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Xbox 360", "Games"]]}
