As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater.Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you've been saving for a special occasion.Meet Your HomiesBut remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you'll run into and remember their faces and their ways:3rd Street SaintsOnce the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood. Now operating out of an abandoned underground hotel, the Saints are looking to reclaim the glory that they lost several years ago.RoninOne of the newest gangs instilling fear in Stilwater, the Ronin recruit from both the city's Asian population as well as among the immigrants. Their crimes involve peddling vice through gambling, prostitution, street-racing, and protection rackets, and their power has reached even into the boardroom of corporations like Ultor.Sons of SamediInfluenced by Voodoo and a history of military corruption in Haiti, the Sons of Samedi are known for their potent combination of spiritualism and fearlessness. Members are attracted to the gang out of respect for their methods, through coercion or a desire for easy income generated through trade in their designer drug called \"Loa Dust.\"BrotherhoodFormed from the cast-outs and dredges of Stilwater society, the Brotherhood is a solid force of strength and intimidation intent on revenging itself upon the police and city. Specializing in violent extortion, they forego subtlety and nuance and simply take what they want, all the while flashing their allegiance with piercings and tattoos, bright colors, and gas-guzzling trucks.Ultor CorporationA ruthless corporate contender, the Ultor Corporation's gentrification of Saints Row created a new skyline for the city and a headquarters for their corporate office at the expense of the poor and the 3rd Street Saints. Now they're targeting another neighborhood, the Shivington projects, fueling gang wars and waiting for the prime moment to move in and reap the profits.Key Game Features:Freedom to Explore Through Open World Gameplay- Balancing story progression with all the time-wasting mayhem imaginable,Saints Row 2contains more activities, diversions, races, cribs, city districts, and interiors than ever before.Extensive Mission Play- Over 40 story missions with additional bonus missions take place in a transformed Stilwater that is over 50% larger than before.Limitless Customization-Saints Row 2allows you to customize everything connected to what you wear, drive and where you live as well as gives you access to countless character combinations from facial expression, body type, voice, taunts, gender to walking style.

Now it's time to take back the city that has forgotten you and only you will decide how far you'll go to achieve that.", "price": 19.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517cAR7fNIL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BLM5PG", "B004QEV0MI", "B00BRQN2EM", "B009DZTXR4", "B0076ZPYPI", "B000FRU1UM", "B002DC8GMM", "B0050SYILE", "B008XMSRKC", "B002EE5ROO", "B002I0HBZW", "B001REZLY8", "B002GN8HU4", "B003S2MXRA", "B000OLXX86", "B002MED6F8", "B003P9C6QY", "B002I0H79C", "B0009S4UOA", "B004FUL9YW", "B0050SY4DG", "B00BMFIXT2", "B005C2D2MO", "B001GJ306U", "B00C71034I", "B0041OWQUI", "B001A4MTGS", "B003C1I0CO", "B0050SYV70", "B002I0K50U", "B0086V5V9A", "B000HCQK0A", "B0016B28Y8", "B002BSA1MQ", "B00309U0M6", "B000F3AADE", "B004HYK956", "B0050SYLRK", "B000P46NMK", "B000WQWPOQ", "B003O6EB70", "B000FRU0NU", "B001UWGDC6", "B00F3F2XAW", "B002V16T0Q", "B0007ZD79E", "B001D7T2VM", "B000TI836G", "B000SQ5LQ4", "B00DJ42EC6", "B002BSA20M", "B002I098JE", "B002BRZ852", "B002I0JA7E", "B00503E8S2", "B0044SA70M", "B000XYUVAC", "B00B59MXDM", "B0050SYFM6", "B004YVOCYG", "B00269QLI8", "B000WEQL02", "B00B59L9VO", "B00EVWZHLK", "B0022TNO7S", "B000GPVUOY", "B000ZK698C", "B0050SWVIQ", "B001SH7YMG", "B00CMC6HZ6", "B00149ILCK", "B003O6CA64", "B0045EI7I4", "B0050SYX8W", "B0044TD9HY", "B005FDUSTA", "B0085CA8NY", "B007M6W38W", "B002Z7BE1U", "B001IK1BJ0", "B0010AYJXI", "B000FRS9II", "B000CQNWH0", "B00C710AZ0", "B00576U8CC", "B0014ULQB2", "B001ASJIRM", "B0087Y3M5G", "B007SRM5MO", "B005EZ5GXW", "B004EW7LSY", "0744010128", "B0050SYWVA", "B001D25M1Q", "B003EV7ED8", "B0050SYK44", "B0010B49IW", "B002I0H2AG", "B002BRZ8BQ"], "bought_together": ["B004QEV0MI", "B00BRQN2EM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BRQN2EM", "B004QEV0MI", "B000BLM5PG", "B009DZTXR4"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1418}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Xbox 360", "Games"]]}
