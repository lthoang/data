Simply insert its high-heat stainless steel probe into meat, shut the oven door, and monitor internal food temperature on a large, easy-to-read digital display. You can even program an alarm to sound when food has reached a desired temperature. Predetermined settings are also available. This capability is especially useful for smoking, barbecuing, or any \"low and slow\" technique--eliminating the need to check on food and allow precious smoke to escape.Unlike other remote probe thermometers, heat resistance makes this versatile tool ideal for candy making or deep fat frying. A special clip secures the probe to your saucepan. Plus, since the Proaccurate withstands temperatures up to 482 degrees Fahrenheit, you won't melt through several probes in the course of a year's cooking.A magnetic back and folding stand let you store the thermometer on a counter or stove. A handy 24-hour count-up, count-down timer also functions solo to aid any cooking task. This commercial-quality thermometer is calibrated to the National Sanitation Foundation standards--the highest standards achievable. It runs on a single AAA battery, included with purchase.--Mary Park"}
