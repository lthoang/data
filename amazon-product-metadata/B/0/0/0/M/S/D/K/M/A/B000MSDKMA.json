{"asin": "B000MSDKMA", "description": "This product is packaged and shipped with extra protection to help protect your investment. Optima YellowTop batteries are made for the extremes. Optima batteries with patented SPIRALCELL Technology deliver that performance. The deep cycle characteristic of this technology coupled with its extreme resistance to vibration provides performance vehicles with the repetitive power they need in a spill-proof package. If the vehicle has a lot of accessories like running lights, high-performance stereo/AV system, winches, or hydraulics, the Optima YellowTop batteries provide the extra performance and deep cycling capability that your vehicle demands. It's perfect for people who are serious about sound. Optima's power is cleaner with higher voltage output than conventional batteries. And they have a greater cycle life so they can be drained and recharged more often. Optima batteries can meet the needs of more enthusiasts in the performance market. Group 51, 35 and 75/25 sizes are made just for your compact power needs. Using Optima SPIRALCELL Technology, cells are tightly compressed into supportive chambers, giving Optima batteries over 15 times more vibration resistance than traditional batteries. This translates into longer battery life. Due to its completely sealed case, the Optima Yellow Top battery is extremely safe and corrosion resistant. Acid can't leak or spill, making them clean, user-friendly and environmentally sound. No matter the conditions, be it dampness, heat, dirt or exposure to extremes, you can count on Optima to deliver uninterrupted power. Optima's ability to hold a higher voltage during the discharge cycle makes it possible to utilize more of the stored power in the Optima compared to ordinary batteries. The YellowTop handles many discharges as well as re-charges without losing significant capacity. Optima is also ideal for seasonal use because of its very low self-discharge rate.", "title": "Optima 8040-218-FFP YellowTop Group 35 Deep Cycle Battery", "price": 169.42, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418nXraQXFL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CQFS0O", "B0060YHP3A", "B006QH55YW", "B006QH56E6", "B006QH55WY", "B00DNU3MIG", "B000P0W5B2", "B000KIV23Q", "B00DTU95Y0", "B000CIPUNC", "B006K8V5M8", "B0060YHLHU", "B009M3PQFA", "B00JJXBBSY", "B0002YE2S0", "B000EVWDU0", "B00316GNYM", "B004LR5K30", "B00F2LRXOI", "B004SRTN3Q", "B000TEMHTE", "B0023NVYYI", "B004SL84Z0", "B000CEBXRS", "B003CEVFV4", "B00E16M1L0", "B007Q2HOYK", "B001G23JZ4", "B004UFHX10", "B005EUVEHE", "B001RNNYDO", "B00030CY5G", "B000CIRTY0", "B007WX0NMS", "B00030CYD8", "B003X51S00", "B000SBTSRC", "B0076S2AMK", "B004WK51U8", "B006QH6XQG", "B003CEFJ2A", "B002Q1INDM", "B006QH55YM", "B000HAB82M", "B000FW2MWW", "B00068XCQU", "B000XDLN96", "B000BQW5LK", "B001AV5ZHG", "B006PK9MIA", "B000BOKML2", "B006QH560A", "B003ZAGPGU", "B001U4ZZPK", "B00CBB72AM", "B0050I6KII", "B000TTILSK", "B001HBYXVS", "B0012BYOSK", "B000COX0JM", "B00ELHTC1G", "B008VGVCPC", "B00BF6HXA8", "B00353G1SY", "B000AAJTXY", "B0002PUI82", "B000FRLO9Y", "B000CQFWRS", "B000P0W5L2", "B003KEGS90", "B000TTO1ZC", "B007UQLR9U", "B000PANG74", "B0050WZX0U", "B004Z0Z4ZW", "B005NLQAHS", "B00D8E0SRA", "B001TCXOTW", "B003L643KS", "B005IUY9JK", "B007TG7I0I", "B0002VM8RU", "B00026Z3E0", "B003RCJB62", "B00020CB2S", "B001N729FS", "B001NG5AM8", "B000MUTAGS", "B003CG9PIC", "B006QH561E", "B000CO869Q", "B004T0WFVE", "B006QH550Q", "B000C5CEKC", "B00H2FK7O0", "B00068OLEW", "B000C5YD1A", "B001QRTZR0", "B000BQSIWK"], "also_viewed": ["B006QH55WY", "B006QH55YW", "B006QH561E", "B006QH55YM", "B006QH56E6", "B00E16M1L0", "B006QH552E", "B004SRTN3Q", "B006QH6XQG", "B008QDK0RQ", "B006QH550Q", "B002496HM0", "B0002ILK6I", "B006QH560A", "B003HIMNPW", "B00E16M1S8", "B00E16M1P6", "B00E16LUSK", "B00E16LTSQ", "B00E16LVYI", "B00AAVISH6", "B006QH54WU", "B006QH56GO", "B002496GK8", "B00E16LU7Q", "B003HIUF84", "B006QH54VQ", "B003E21AG4", "B00E16LTTK", "B000BJBHNY", "B009M3PQFA", "B00FRTA0YU", "B00249CSS2", "B00DHGPVKI", "B001VV0318", "B0054812K0", "B00EUFCHR0", "B00249CQUM", "B00IG4423S", "B003TTTQW2", "B0002ILK7M", "B0002ILK72", "B000LUBQ4I", "B005GVT6V2", "B000P0W5B2", "B001GMTIP4", "B001GN0COE", "B008QDHJZC", "B004MLZURG", "B008974VFG", "B00099HVM2", "B00IG442II", "B00249GW9S", "B00DJLQ1H8", "B0045G8KBQ", "B000CQFS0O", "B005FYJ5B6", "B00FRT9D2A"], "bought_together": ["B000CQFS0O"]}, "categories": [["Automotive", "Performance Parts & Accessories", "Batteries & Accessories", "Battery Accessories"]]}
