The Taiyo Yuden white inkjet surface is hub printable, meaning it will accept printing all the way to the center hub of the disc, giving you the maximum print area possible, perfect for both text and photo-quality labels. It will work well with inkjet DVD & CD disc printers made by Primera, Rimage, Epson, HP and others. This product is not recommended for silk screening.  Taiyo Yuden is recognized as a leader in the manufacture of reliable, accurate media for CD and DVD recording. Their 16X DVD-R media allows faster writing speeds. Taiyo Yuden pioneered high-speed DVD-R technology in late 2002 when it introduced the industry's first media to support 4X-speed writing. Now you can go beyond that barrier to achieve DVD recording in record time!"}
