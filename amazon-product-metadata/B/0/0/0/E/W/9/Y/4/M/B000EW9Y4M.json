This high-speed autofocus system combines with the circular aperture to create a shallow depth of field that brings attention to the subject and blurs the background, an ideal effect for portraits and weddings. In addition, the lens's floating optical system includes an aspherical lens element that suppresses aberrations and produces an excellent imaging performance.SpecificationsFocal length: 85mmMaximum aperture: f/1.2Lens construction: 8 elements in 7 groupsAngle of view: 28 degrees @ 30 feetFocus adjustment: Autofocus with full-time manualClosest focusing distance: 3.2 feetFilter size: 72mmDimensions: 3.6 inches in diameter and 3.3 inches longWeight: 36.2 ouncesWarranty: 1 yearRetaining the impressive optical performance and large aperture of the original EF 85mm f1.2L USM, this new medium telephoto lens uses a ring-type USM, high-speed CPU, and optimized algorithms to achieve an autofocus speed approximately 1.8x faster than the original.
