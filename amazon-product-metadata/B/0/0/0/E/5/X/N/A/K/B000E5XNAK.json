Instead, it produces true whole-room air circulation using Vortex Technology, exclusive to Vornado. So rather than being in the breeze or out of the breeze with an ordinary fan, you get an even temperature and circulation throughout the room. The Vornado 783 Whole Room Air Circulator uses the signature energy efficient Vortex Action to powerfully move air up to 100 feet to provide quality whole room air circulation and the best comfort. In addition to being one of Vornado's most powerful circulators, the 783 can easily adjust the height from 28\" to 40\". Direct the airflow where you need it with the fully adjustable head. This air circulator is ideal for use in large rooms. Comes with an easy to use 3-speed control, the 783 is engineered to be simple to use and maintain. Use all year for energy savings in every season. Backed by Vornado's industry-leading 5-year warranty. Model is made for 120 volts only."}
