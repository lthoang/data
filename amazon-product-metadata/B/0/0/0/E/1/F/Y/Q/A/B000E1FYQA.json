{"asin": "B000E1FYQA", "description": "The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds are the ideal ear buds for use with portable MP3, CD, MD, DVD players and many other portable devices with 3.5mm headphone sockets. Soft silicone-rubber ear adapters in three different sizes are included to ensure a perfect fit, high wearing comfort and an excellent attenuation of ambient noise. These ear buds, with their in-ear, sound-isolating design, offer powerful, bass-driven stereo performance. Extremely small and lightweight -- they weigh a bit more than an ounce -- the CX300-B will go wherever you take them. Designed in a stylish black finish, the ear buds include a 3.5mm L-shaped plug and 21-inch asymmetrical cable. Sennheiser, an acknowledged world leader in headphone-transducer technology, offers a two-year manufacturer's warranty on the CX300-B.", "title": "Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) - Old Version", "price": 59.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ZJ33WQ5L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001EZYMF4", "B000E6G9RI", "B001RNO8ZC", "B0035JKJ40", "B001EZUQ5E", "B000VRBLMS", "B004HD4L2E", "B008V6T1IW", "B001GSX7R8", "B001RNO8ZW", "B0018Z7EIM", "B005EIVL5G", "B0034L72G2", "B009E6J8U4", "B0035JKJ68", "B009ES68P0", "B00452TDRK", "B005QXAAOC", "B0035Y1T4E", "B005EIVKLQ", "B005HJ38OO", "B005EIVL74", "B0038W0K2U", "B0038W0K2K", "B002YO8WRI", "B001EZWNWS", "B005HP3OB0", "B005QXAAMY", "B00K3MH7LK", "B005BCCMXU", "B00001P4XA", "B004PNZFZ8", "B004BDOQAC", "B005M1KO1C", "B003WV39B6", "B00EWOK09G", "B004ZLV02C", "B0000CE1UO", "B0035JKJAE", "B008X9Q0JK", "B0094R4POC", "B0034L3G8U", "B00426DND4", "B005S3H836", "B00ISL3PPU", "B004ZLUZOG", "B00B4RCHWW", "B007UNOH0O", "B001EZWO5O", "B002NUJ2RM", "B000E1DSAE", "B002GQPT52", "B005BHIZ7M", "B001LNO722", "B002EL4MXY", "B001FWYXF0", "B001V9LPT4", "B007HISSXE", "B005W1DSU6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EZYMF4", "B0038W0K2K", "B004PNZFZ8", "B0038W0K2U"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Headphones"]]}
