{"asin": "B000E1DSAE", "description": "The Sennheiser CX300-S Earbuds are the ideal ear buds for use with portable MP3, CD, MD, DVD players and many other portable devices with 3.5mm headphone sockets. Soft silicone-rubber ear adapters in three different sizes are included to ensure a perfect fit, high wearing comfort and an excellent attenuation of ambient noise. These ear buds, with their in-ear, sound-isolating design, offer powerful, bass-driven stereo performance. Extremely small and lightweight -- they weigh a bit more than an ounce -- the CX300-S will go wherever you take them. Designed in a stylish silver finish, the ear buds include a 3.5mm L-shaped plug and 21-inch asymmetrical cable. Sennheiser, an acknowledged world leader in headphone-transducer technology, offers a two-year manufacturer's warranty on the CX300-S.", "title": "Sennheiser CX 300S Bass-Driven Lightweight In-Ear Headphone (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 32.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K4234J23L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001EZYMF4", "B001EZUQ5E", "B001RNO8ZC", "B005QXAAOC", "B000VRBLMS", "B005EIVKLQ", "B004HD4L2E", "B008V6T1IW", "B002REBVU0", "B009ES68P0", "B001RNO8ZW", "B0034L72G2", "B001GSX7R8", "B009E6J8U4", "B0035Y1T4E", "B0035JKJJU", "B000E6G9RI", "B005S3H836", "B0035JKJAE", "B005920DVA", "B004ZLUZGY", "B00B4RCHWW", "B002YO8WRI", "B005EIVL5G", "B004BDOQAC", "B008D76Q64", "B005BHIZ7M", "B001EZWO5O", "B00A34TU7W", "B006K55662", "B0094R4PBU", "B0094R4POC", "B005EIVL74", "B001EZWNWS", "B001FWYXF0", "B0035JKJC2", "B001EZTJ6Q", "B0035JKJLI", "B005HP3OB0", "B0035JKJ40", "B004S7Q8CA", "B000E6G9RS", "B004RE3YU8", "B00C6VOZ02", "B00C30FCUI", "B00361ERCC", "B002EL4MXY", "B00C30HUQ2", "B000E1FYQA", "B0043M9ATI", "B005M7AVLO", "B005M1KO1C", "B008X8HZZO", "B003CP0KCS", "B004ZLV02C", "B004ZLUZOG", "B00G4UQ6U8", "B001U5YZ4G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EZYMF4", "B001EZUQ5E", "B001RNO8ZC", "B004S7Q8CA"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Headphones"]]}
