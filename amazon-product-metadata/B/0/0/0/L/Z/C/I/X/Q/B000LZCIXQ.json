It features 802.11g technology that makes accessing files and networked peripherals-such as hard drives, printers, CD-ROMs, and DVDs-easier than ever. 802.11g technology provides you with networking speeds nearly five times faster than the current Wi-Fi (802.11b) standard. An integrated, 4-port 10/100Base-T Ethernet switch also allows you to connect wired computers to the network. 802.11g technology is the easiest wireless network to implement. The Router uses the wireless 802.11g 2.4GHz standard to offer you 400 feet of wireless coverage. 802.11g technology is backward compatible with the 802.11b Wi-Fi networking standard, so it allows you to implement faster wireless technologies in combination with existing 802.11b Wi-Fi networks.", "title": "Belkin ME1004-R Wireless Cable/DSL Router", "price": 19.99, "salesRank": {"Electronics": 63969}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pVBM7%2Bd3L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FWYGJS", "B000JV9LUK", "B001UI4RTG", "B000BTL0OA", "B0045HG53K", "B002M3SHXA", "B003Y5RYNY", "B00IF0JAIU", "B0098QV038", "B008A2OG3C", "B004T9RR6I", "B0087NZ31S", "B0088CJT4U", "B004XC6GJ0", "B00F0DD0I6", "B00AJHDZSI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FWYGJS", "B00A3YN0Z0", "B004NBZ98K", "B0001MQSB2"]}}
