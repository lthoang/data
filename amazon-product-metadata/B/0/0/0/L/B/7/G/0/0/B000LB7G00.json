Unlike a conventional mouse that confines movement to a flat plane, the SpaceNavigator 3D mouse makes it much easier to control 3D models and scenes. By gently pushing, pulling, tilting or sliding the SpaceNavigator&#146;s pressure sensitive controller cap users simultaneously move objects with six degrees of freedom. By varying the amount of pressure on the cap users can easily accelerate or decelerate actions with precision.The Perfect Companion for 3D applications.Unique pressure sensing technology makes the 3D mouse a virtual extension of a user&#146;s body&#151;and the perfect companion for today&#146;s most popular 3D applications, including SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk 3ds Max, Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended, ArchiCAD, and many more.An Indispensable Asset\"I've been a user since 1998. I find your products are an indispensable asset in doing my job easier and quicker and with less repetitive stress. If you work on a CAD system, do yourself a big favour and get one of these products.\" Dana Fiorucci Senior Design EngineerWhy use a SpaceNavigator 3D mouse?The key advantage of a SpaceNavigator over a mouse and keyboard is the ease of performing intricate adjustments to camera views and models without repeatedly stopping to change direction, zoom, or rotate. With a SpaceNavigator you can do all three at once while simultaneously using the mouse to access commands and tools.Heavy for precision.A heavy (479 grams) brushed stainless steel base keeps the SpaceNavigator stationary and provides a stable platform for the spring-mounted pressure sensitive controller cap.Convenience.Universal compatibility:Works with all your favorite 3D applications--on Windows, Mac, or Linux.Affordable precision:Step up to advanced 3D technology--at a price that&#146;s comparable with many 2D mice.Space saving:The small footprint of SpaceNavigator 3D mouse conserves space. Your work area remains uncluttered, even if you&#146;re also using a conventional mouse."}
