This simple implement doesn't have a digital clock, doesn't blink when it's ready, and doesn't have a tiny computer chip imbedded in it to do all the work. It takes a bit of pressing and squeezing, but the light and airy potatoes that result will be both memorable and worth the work. Place boiled potatoes in the bowl of the ricer, set it across a saucepan (using the ridge on the head of the bowl), and press the potatoes through the disk--that's it. Stir in a bit of butter and cream, dust with paprika, and enjoy. And be sure to try the ricer with other root vegetables, such as carrots, yams, and turnips.--C. Whitney-Ward"}
