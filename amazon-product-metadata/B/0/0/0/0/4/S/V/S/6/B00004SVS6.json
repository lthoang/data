{"asin": "B00004SVS6", "description": "Released less than a year after Mega Man 4, Mega Man 5 continues the series' tradition of solid gameplay, pitting the eponymous character against his brother Proto Man and his band of eight robot masters: Gravity Man, Stone Man, Charge Man, Crystal Man, Napalm Man, Gyro Man and Star Man. Rush and Fliptop are on hand to help the blue bomber in his quest, as is a new bird-like robot called Beat, who can be obtained by collecting the letters to spell \"Mega Man V.\" The graphics and soundtrack live up to what players have come to expect from the series -- they're some of the best the NES has to offer. ~ Skyler Miller, All Game Guide", "price": 299.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bGBvZH0nL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004SVS7", "B00004SVS5", "B00004SVS3", "B00005AV8W", "B00004SVYF", "B00004SVXW", "B00002SVFV", "B0009VRFFS", "B00004SVNB", "B00004SVYE", "B00004SVR9", "B00005AV8O", "B00004SVNS", "B00002STJH", "B00004SVOO", "B00004SVXQ", "B000035Y2Q", "B000035XFY", "B00004SVQR", "B00004SVV8", "B00005NCCZ", "B00004SVS9", "B00005ATSM", "B0002TQK9E", "B000MFOOLY", "B00004SVV4", "B000HFGKN4", "B00BEZY2I6", "B00002SVFR", "B000GU49P6", "B00004SVPJ", "B00002SVF6", "B00030GS80", "B00002SVG3", "B000FUIS40", "B000006OVJ", "B00004SVV9", "B00004SVP8", "B002FY0CM0", "B0007V0Y1C", "B00002ST27", "B00004SVV7", "B00002STXN", "B000H29ZPM", "B0002ST1YQ", "B00004SVV1", "B00002SVG0", "B00004SVPT", "B002DLOM6C", "B0006TNCEG", "B00004SVWV", "B000035Y6C", "B00004SVNL", "B00002STJI", "B00004SVN9", "B000059S78"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004SVS7", "B00004SVS5", "B00004SVS3", "B009I6SH16"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 13175}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo NES", "Games"]]}
