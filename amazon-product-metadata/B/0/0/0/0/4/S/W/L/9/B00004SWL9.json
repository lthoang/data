{"asin": "B00004SWL9", "description": "Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.
