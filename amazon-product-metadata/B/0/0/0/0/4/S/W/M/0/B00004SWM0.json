{"asin": "B00004SWM0", "description": "Though it lacks the dramatic intensity of theFinal  Fantasyseries--the crown prince of console role-playing  games--SquareSoft'sLegend of Manastill satisfies with its beautiful  hand-drawn sets and its innovative nonlinear gameplay.Billed as the sequel to the Super Nintendo'sSecrets of Mana,Legend of Mana's story contains more than 60 self-contained  miniquests, but generally the goal is to restore the world's Mana, or  life energy. Gamers won't need to be obsessive about winning all the  quests, but there are some challenges that must be completed if you  wish to reach the final showdown. The game begins as players choose  either a male or female lead character while a map displays the new  lands within the world of Fa'Diel. In each of these lands, players will  find items and clues they can use in other lands. The fragmented nature  of the game can be disorienting for gamers looking for quick  gratification. A diary can be used to keep track of current miniquests,  while an encyclopedia neatly organizes the vast amount of story players  uncover. Due to the vast nature of this game's plot, you'll likely need  these features to stay focused on your quests.Animefans will be wowed by the character design and beautifully  illustrated storybook backgrounds.
