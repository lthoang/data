{"asin": "B00004SVV8", "description": "GREAT GAME. SUPER MARIO BROTHERS PART 2 FOR NES NINTENDO. ALL-TIME CLASSIC. A MUST FOR ANY TRUE HARDCORE GAMER, COLLECTOR OR GAME PLAYER. LOTS OF FUN. HERE IS SOME MINOR INFO ON THE GAME. \n\nPlayers choose from four characters each time they start or restart a level: Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach. Each has a special ability: Luigi can jump very high, the Princess can remain temporarily suspended in the air as if she were levitating, Toad can pick up things quickly and is very agile, and Mario is well-balanced in all areas. This is the only original Super Mario game where Princess Peach is not the damsel-in-distress along with being the first playable female character in a Mario game. In future Mario games in which multiple characters were playable, with the exception of Mario Golf, Mario would always be the most balanced character. A unique ability in this game is the \"power squat\"; by holding Down on the control pad for a few seconds, players could build power for higher jumps. One of the game's most defining aspect is the ability to pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies; these vegetables reappear in Super Smash Bros. Melee as one of Peach's special attacks.", "price": 999.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Jhvhp-o6L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004SVV9", "B00004SVV7", "B00004SVXW", "B00004SVXP", "B000FJEV06", "B00004SVVT", "B00005AV8O", "B0009VRFFS", "B000TUZCQI", "B000VA5Y1Y", "B00004SVYF", "B00002STXQ", "B00004SVYQ", "B000UCF9TA", "B00004SVYE", "B00005AV8W", "B00004SVOG", "B00004SVYT", "B00004SVSS", "B00004SVR9", "B000MFOOLY", "B001VDZN3O", "B00004SVNS", "B00004SVVN", "B003VH5Z2C", "B0006TNCEG", "B00002SVFZ", "B00004SVV4", "B00004SVXV", "B00002SVFR", "B002RYLG4Q", "B000MEA9TQ", "B00004SVYH", "B000FUIS40", "B00004SVPT", "B0009KMYUK", "B00004SVXQ", "B00004SVTL", "B00004SVS3", "B00004SVUM", "B0034ZOAKO", "B002KJ02ZC", "B00004SVTH", "B00002ST7F", "B006457FUI", "B00AO7ZTZK", "B0002ST1YQ", "B000035Y7H", "B00004SVS9", "B0002Z1PZW", "B00004SVW4", "B00002STXN", "B00004SVTT", "B003Y5AHPG", "B00004SVVP", "B003O3EFY2", "B000035Y6D", "B0012NZK8G", "B00004SVP2", "B000035Y6C", "B00004SVTO", "B00004SVS5", "B000NO4X10", "B00004SVNL", "B00002SVFM", "B002DLOM6C", "B00004SVX1", "B000EHJF7I", "B0002TQK9E", "B00004SVQU", "B00002STYS", "B00002SVFQ", "B00EAM862S", "B00004SVYP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004SVV9", "B000TUZCQI", "B00004SVV7", "B00004SVXW"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2302}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo NES", "Games"]]}
