{"asin": "B00004U1R2", "description": "Conker's Bad Fur Dayis for adults, the ESRB has rated thisgame Mature; it should not be bought for--or played by or around--children. That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.", "price": 218.88, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516wluEIzmL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DMAQ", "B00004SWLT", "B00000J2W7", "B00000DMAX", "B00004U1R3", "B00000F1GM", "B00002STEZ", "B00002DHEV", "B00000DMAT", "B000JVM256", "B00002STGL", "B00000ID61", "B00002STH0", "B00004U1R1", "B000046Q7Q", "B00000INR2", "B00004S9AA", "B00005M8TL", "B000YOCGUO", "B000031KJT", "B005GTNBGK", "B00000IFRI", "B00000I1BB", "B00003OTI3", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00000DMB2", "B000PJHAD6", "B0015OG4G4", "B00005AW1W", "B00004S9A7", "B0009Y808Q", "B005DI7N7W", "B00000DMB5", "B00004R9IB", "B00002STFD", "B003UI5GLC", "B00002STFH", "B000031KJM", "B005GTNC8W", "B00004U1QY", "B000058BCU", "B000F9JFXE", "B005GTND0E", "B00000K2G7", "B00000K1AF", "B00002STFP", "B00000JQ0V", "B002TK1PX0", "B00001X5BU", "B000021Y0W", "B00002STFN", "B00000I1BE", "B00002STH5", "B00002STGN", "B00000K2GI", "B0006SST9U", "B00001TZYA", "B007SJMEHI", "B00002STGU", "B000QHOHHE", "B00001WRJO", "B00004UG9B", "B00004R9I4", "B00000J2OO", "B000021Y30", "B00002970G", "B0046CZX78", "B000046S41", "B001CYBXMC", "B009MRZAUC", "B000050FAE", "B00002STGE", "B00000JHPD", "B00001ZWP8", "B00001WQIS", "B0009UBR3A", "B00001OX4T", "B00004TJE5", "B00002SVG3", "B00004WLMA", "B00001P4VO", "B00002STHX", "B00002SVFV", "B00005Q8M0", "B000084318", "B00002SVG2", "B00000DMB9"], "bought_together": ["B00000DMAX", "B00000J2W7"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000DMAT", "B0006SST9U", "B00000DMAQ", "B002TK1PX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4790}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
