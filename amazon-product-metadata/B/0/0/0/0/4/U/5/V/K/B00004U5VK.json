{"asin": "B00004U5VK", "description": "PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker", "price": 34.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eAV3pk8CL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000066TS3", "B00019HNNM", "B000CQ75VY", "B0009RG8DW", "B00005NCCR", "B00005ME6N", "B0000TSR7Y", "B00005BW7Q", "B00005ML10", "B000088KH9", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00005ME6O", "B0002XL3BA", "B00004YRQA", "B000066JRQ", "B00005TNI6", "B00005ML0X", "B00005OLX1", "B000B69E9G", "B0000A09EM", "B00005V6B9", "B000FIVC2W", "B0002A6CPA", "B0000A92KX", "B00004ZDFY", "B00007E1OA", "B00005Q8IR", "B00009ZVHW", "B000063RRN", "B00005V5MZ", "B00020LZAW", "B0001ADAME", "B00004U5VF", "B00006LELI", "B00005NN5J", "B000G6SPHI", "B00008URUA", "B00006LEMX", "B0001NBNHU", "B00005B70K", "B000TLU67W", "B000FDOTIQ", "B001BP4JY6", "B00005J536", "B0000A8VBZ", "B0009XBWY6", "B0009Z3K9O", "9629971372", "B000066TS5", "B00024W1U6", "B000056SNY", "B000E49SGE", "B000F5IH2I", "B00009ZVHY", "B0007L8GPI", "B00007LV7Y", "B001MW91IW", "B00007KQC1", "B00001ZWMV", "B000IONGU4", "B000038ABO", "B0030GBSUC", "B00004YKHU", "B0002IQD1U", "B00007D02V", "B00006Z7HR", "B003QX4F7C", "B001UIG6M2", "B0011BE3KA", "B000FG65EE", "B0002CHJAA", "0744000556", "B000088KH1", "B00005BIG7", "B00K85X1TE", "B0009R1T9K", "B00007UHPJ", "B0000C7GHG", "B0001A86EG", "B0017R5SYI", "B00015MFYI", "B000G0O6CW", "B00009YEK1", "B00004U5VI", "B005VBVQDI", "B0007XTNFS", "B000A5K5MI", "B000FPGZUE", "B0009351R0", "B00009KO3N", "B0009A4EVM", "B00004WLQV", "B00008H2IW", "B00019HNNC", "B00009KO3L", "B0001I9YHG", "B0029MAXR2", "B000G77X34", "B000095ZH6"], "bought_together": ["B000066TS3", "B00019HNNM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000066TS3", "B000CQ75VY", "B00019HNNM", "B00005V5MZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 6754}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
