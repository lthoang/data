{"asin": "B00004UE0O", "description": "Black & Whiteis a role-playing game unlike any other you've played before. You play the role of a deity in a land where the surroundings are yours to shape and its people are yours to lord over. Be an evil, malevolent god and the natives will worship you with fear in their eyes. Play as a kind, benevolent god and they will worship you with love in their hearts. Your actions decide whether you create a heaven or hell for your worshipers. Then select a creature from the land to act as your representative in the world. Raise it to gigantic proportions and teach it to do your bidding--whether the animal grows into an evil colossus of mass destruction or a kind and gentle giant is up to you. Progress through the game's rich storyline performing powerful miracles to battle other deities and become the world's supreme god.", "price": 11.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CDJ7TQ6XL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007GBBHI", "B000EVMK8K", "B000KKVO7I", "B0000CE1IN", "B0010L1TVM", "B0002L88HE", "B0013ET44K", "B00001LDCK", "B001IK6V4K", "B000FN7K2S", "B000P5BSUQ", "B0006BC2PO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007GBBHI", "B000EVMK8K", "B0000CE1IN", "B00026D13A"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 13792}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PC", "Games"]]}
