{"asin": "B00004VX3T", "description": "The first thing you'll notice when you start using the Logitech WheelMan Mouse is the red glow coming from the bottom. That's because this mouse reads movement optically instead of with a ball, which means you get improved accuracy and fewer moving parts to break down. And you don't need a mouse pad--most smooth surfaces will do. You can also go for months without having to stop to clean it, unlike conventional mice, which collect gunk in the ball and need to be cleaned all the time. Its buttons can be programmed to perform common commands, and you can use the wheel to scroll down windows without scroll bars. The WheelMan fits comfortably in either the left or right hand. It is for use with PCs or Macs.", "title": "Logitech 930495-0403 Corded Optical Wheelmouse", "price": 23.57, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41186QZFSJL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B002B3YCQM", "B003B4BBFK", "B003L62T7W", "B002ZIN9DU", "B002LKZTGC", "B00G5TDGK6", "B00B7GV802", "B000H51GA6", "B00902BFGC", "B00FPAVUHC", "B00CAJNY16", "B00CAJOUBO", "B00CAJNVUK", "B0000A1GOF", "B009ZPS3WS", "B000HGMMH6", "B000F1MSJK", "B00CAJO474", "B005058B4W", "B005EJH6RW", "B007B5V268", "B00BCEK2LK", "B003ELVLKU", "B00006HTZ0", "B00BCEK2LA", "B005DLDTAE", "B00CBQO930", "B003VANO7C", "B00BP5KOPA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002B3YCQM", "B005EJH6RW", "B003B4BBFK", "B009ZPS3WS"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Mice"]]}
