{"asin": "B00004WMVL", "description": "A first-person-shooter based on theResident Evilseries of  \"survival horror\" video games,Resident Evil: Survivoris an unfortunate  casualty of political correctness. It's painfully obvious that this game was  meant to be played with a light gun, which the Japanese version supports, but  the U.S. version decidedly does not. Instead, a rudimentary control scheme using  the PlayStation controller has been substituted, one which is simply ill-suited  for the otherwise unmodified arcade-style gameplay.Were it not for this major shortcoming,Resident Evil: Survivor's other  flaws would be more tolerable, if not excusable. The attempt here to graft  various elements of theResident Evilgames onto a shoot-'em-up just  doesn't take. The plot--which casts the player as an amnesiac who survives a  helicopter crash only to find himself in a foreboding town swarming with zombies  and other hideous biotechnological mutations--is more of a side story to theResident Evilsaga, and not a very interesting one at that. The game's  puzzles practically solve themselves, and while your character is free (more or  less) to go where he pleases, the gameplay is so terribly linear that it might  as well take place on a predetermined track. Once you factor in the game's  coarse graphics, choppy animation, and spotty sound, what you're left with here  is far more horrible than horrifying.--Joe HonPros:Provides some side-story elements to theResident EvilsagaCons:No light gun support; substituted controls ill-suited for arcade-style  gameplayCoarse graphics, choppy animation, and spotty soundShort game length with practically no replay value", "price": 139.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jnnR68RML._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009KO3N", "B00000I1BY", "B0007L8GPI", "B000034DMG", "B0000TSRA6", "B00000K1VA", "B0019LMXAY", "B00000K1VE", "B00005ME6N", "B00006LELI", "B000CBCVFE", "B000B69E9G", "B00004XOM1", "B002I0GKA4", "B00001XDUB", "B00269DXR0", "B0020H46D8", "B00001X50M", "B00269DXXO", "B000P297F2", "B00000K10U", "B000QTD05C", "B000038ABO", "B00000I1BJ", "B0045U4U52", "B000006RGS", "B00B59L9T6", "B0000657SP", "0744003458", "B004UDB9SA", "B00005V6B5", "B0001Y7404", "B000006RGQ", "B0000541Z7", "B0011BE3KA", "B001SI39E2", "B00007KQC5", "B0000A09EN", "B00005QF5P", "0671024396", "B00000DMAR", "B00002STJN", "B00000I1BF", "B00002STPL", "B0000TSR7Y", "B000021Y5U", "B008H6GH8I", "B00000DMB4", "B001CLG6SG", "B00000I1BG", "B00007LV7Y", "B00001ZUGT", "B00006599U", "B0007UDYU6", "0761530312", "B00000I1BZ", "B0002A6CQ4", "0744004799", "B00001YVBL", "B00004W4QJ", "B000021Y2F", "B000TLU67W", "B00019HNNC", "B00001ZWUQ", "B00007KQC4", "B00009WAVA", "B00005BW7M", "B00001OWYW", "B00000I1C0", "B000HKMG14", "B000CBCVG8", "B00006C28X", "B00000I1BR", "B00004YRQA", "B0001Y73YQ", "B0002ILS24", "B00002STKR", "B000006P0K", "0761536965", "B0000568U1", "B000WCQWR6", "B00000I1BT", "B00000K2X5", "B0078KG61C", "B00000I1BQ", "B002CZ3SLO", "B006476318", "B00001P4Y6", "B00005Q8LR", "B00004R8XR", "B00002STTR", "0744014425", "B00000K2G7", "B00001ZT9E", "B000FDOTIQ", "B004UDLRMS", "B000TYQL1O", "B00005MA97"], "bought_together": ["B00009KO3N", "B0007L8GPI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000I1BY", "B000034DMG", "B0000TSRA6", "B00000K1VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 9289}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
