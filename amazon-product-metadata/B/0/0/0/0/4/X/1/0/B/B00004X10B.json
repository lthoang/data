{"asin": "B00004X10B", "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Bags & Cases", "Camera Cases"]], "description": "Roomy enough to hold two camera bodies, seven to eight lenses and a  flash, the Tamrac Pro 12 camera bag is the ideal solution for the photographer  who requires a complete assortment of equipment. The foam-padded main  compartment, in conjunction with the padded dividers, provides a soft, gripping  web of protection for your camera equipment. Accessory pockets abound. The top  flap has mesh pockets for filters and other flat accessories. The front has two  zipped flaps with mesh pockets on the inside, as well as internal pockets that  conveniently hold whatever is needed. Padded side pockets can hold additional  items, while the overhanging top section protects the contents from the weather.  Internal pockets can hold batteries, calculators, tickets, or anything else that  needs holding. Also includes film pockets that can store film and are even  detachable from the bag itself, preventing exposure to x-rays, and allowing easy  inspection by officials. Carrying the Pro 12 is a breeze with either the handle  or the padded shoulder strap. When using the handle, a torsion bar stabilizer  strut in the top distributes the weight.", "title": "Tamrac 5612 Pro 12 Camera Bag (Black)", "price": 149.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pYQgH%2BqhL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Tamrac", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045KGZOG", "B001KELVS0", "B00004ZCI3", "B007FH1KX2", "B00004X109", "B007NDL56A", "B0000BZLBQ", "B000L9OIQC", "B00004ZCJM", "1781451001", "B00EE1ZH6I", "B007FH1FZ0", "B0083Z6R4W", "B0043RTLNS", "B003TYDBYQ", "B0040609WO", "B0033PRWSW", "B0095ZLP3C", "B005KEL4NI", "B00004ZCJI", "B00021EE4U", "B007G5NNOW", "B0095ZKUD8", "B00AN8U0Y0", "B000VDCT3C", "B00JQ4HZPO", "B00017LSPI", "B008I2175E", "B002ZIMEMW", "B004TGZ7WM", "B00004ZCIB", "B0042X9L6A", "B0000BZL8H", "B0050YG3CU", "B008RBD2YA", "B0009M1O9A", "B003Y30334", "B003G3QK4S", "B003XDU2Y0", "B00009R6VZ", "B00IB02Y3M", "B00AE1M31Y", "B003UOIMAS", "B00004X10C", "B00603RTC8", "B00F3BLMLW", "B007NDL54C", "B00DH7WP9W", "B0056TYRMW", "B001F6TXME", "B002PWHOYG", "B004V6BQ3O", "B002WR7VSS", "B001E3ZNL8", "B00FSG1INY", "B00DMS0GTC", "B00AE1LVZS", "B001ENW61I", "B0007U00XK", "B00436G2OU", "B00603RTCI", "B002L60TTI", "0321544080", "B000KZ70JE", "B001GCVA0U", "B004Y1AYAC", "B000EZL1EA", "B007ORX8ME", "B000JLM50I", "B007FGYZFI", "B00CXM03D2", "B006TZE0UQ", "B00796D03C", "B007FGZ1V0", "B004TAA4OY", "B0034WR71G", "B00007EDZG", "B00009VQJZ", "B00006JN3G", "B00603RW48", "B006LZQ6O2", "B0009PAVI2", "B002NEGTSI", "B009B0MZ8U", "B002N694A6", "1933952806", "B00BAFNSIU", "B002TG3NXO", "B00E8NLOY6", "B00009R9EO", "B00CH6ATMO", "B000VDF5VK", "0817439390", "0415831458", "B00AEEDRFM", "B003ZDHP7U", "0321617657", "0321646878", "B007M54E1M", "B002JCSV8U"], "bought_together": ["B001KELVS0", "B007NDL56A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004X109", "B00200K2UG", "B00004WCGC", "B00CF5OHZ2"]}}
