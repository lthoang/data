{"asin": "B00004XOWT", "description": "If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall", "price": 199.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416GAQ5G26L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000637T7S", "B0015IXKSK", "B0015MMN6G", "B001DIFV98", "B0045L3SNQ", "B000PWAAAI", "B00000I1BQ", "B00000I1BF", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BR", "B000034DCF", "B00000JRSB", "B001TEYMRI", "B00004U4R8", "B00005MA97", "B00004U4R9", "B0062DIGA0", "B000029706", "B00004S9AF", "B007UHQO6A", "B00001X50M", "B00004Y57G", "B00002SVWG", "B00000K2X5", "B0000296O5", "B00000IODY", "B000021Y5P", "B00004TBGT", "B00000I1C0", "B00001QHW9", "B000006P0K", "B00000K1VK", "B000GACEHQ", "B00000I1BY", "B00000I1C1", "B000034DC2", "B00004TC6E", "B000034DMG", "B000K6TOK6", "B00000DMAV", "B000SEU92W", "B00005NGLC", "B00008RUYZ", "B000034DC6", "B000006RGS", "B0019LMXAY", "B00001XDUB", "B000006RGR", "B00000I1BK", "B00001QED2", "B00000DMB6", "B00005NCAY", "B00002R28M", "B00000I1BS", "B00008G97F", "B00002STJN", "B00004R9IG", "B00005NGLA", "B000034DC7", "B00005CDR8", "B00004TEXU", "B00005LOXE", "B00004YZAO", "B00002R28C", "B000038ABO", "B000031KJI", "B00004WKHO", "B00000JNHJ", "B00005NGLD", "B00000J9JI", "B000TLU67W", "B00005M8TC", "B00005NGR0", "B00001OWYW", "B000006RGQ", "B00000DMB4", "B00004ZEEH", "B00002R28F", "B00005Y402", "B00000IZ8A", "B000038AAU", "B00000K2R4", "B0007MZWQS", "B00000DMAU", "B00005NISJ", "B000006OVJ", "B00005NN7B", "B000034DMT", "B00001WRIY", "1566867142", "B00000K1V2", "156686903X", "B00000INRB", "B00000K1VE", "B00000JQQH", "B00000JHPN"], "bought_together": ["B0015MMN6G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K6TOK6", "B0045L3SNQ", "B000GACEHQ", "B0015MMN6G"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2640}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Hardware"]]}
