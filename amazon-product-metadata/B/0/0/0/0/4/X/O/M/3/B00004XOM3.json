Macro lenses can uncover detail that would be impossible to detect by the eye and give new perspective to extremely minute subjects such as insects or the petals of a small flower, and this lens is no exception. The lens offers such features as a three-group floating system for exceptional close-up performance; a secondary diaphragm that blocks stray light at f/2.8, which increases contrast when shooting wide open; a ultra-sonic monitor (USM) that provides outstanding autofocusing speed at all focusing distances; a wide manual focusing ring with smooth action; and full-time manual focus even in AF mode. The first lens in its class to feature inner focusing, the lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 100mmMaximum aperture: 1:2.8Lens construction: 12 elements in 8 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 24 degreesFocus adjustment: Inner focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 1 foot (film plane to subject)Filter size: 58mmDimensions: 3.1 inches in diameter, 4.7 inches longWeight: 21.1 ounces"}
