With 3-D games such asPerfect DarkandDonkey Kong&nbsp;64getting the bulk of  attention among consumers,Kirby 64provides a fun change of pace for both  young and experienced gamers who don't necessarily need all three  dimensions to have fun.Young gamers will love the bright, colorful graphics in this game,  which is 2-D with some 3-D foreground and background elements. Kirby is  joined by plenty of friends who will aid in his quest to recover the  pieces of an important shattered crystal.While the levels are a bit too easy for older gamers, the gameplay inKirby&nbsp;64is original enough to entertain all ages. Kirby  still has an appetite for enemies, sucking them up and spitting them  out, but he can also swallow them, inheriting abilities such as fire  and cutter. Also, Kirby can now combine enemy powers, often with  hilarious results. For instance, electricity plus stone turns Kirby  into an electrifying little light bulb. Sure, you don't need to use all  these powers, but they're still fun to play with.--Robb GuidoPros:Whimsical 2-D graphicsKirby 64's copy and combine abilities result in some unique and varied  gameplayCons:May be too easy and too cute for older players", "price": 509.97, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lyMzeLNwL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002STFH", "B00003OTI3", "B00000F1GM", "B00002STEZ", "B00004U1R3", "B00000J2W7", "B00000DMAQ", "B000031KJM", "B00000ID61", "B00002DHEV", "B00004SWLT", "B00004U1QY", "B00002STH0", "B000058BCU", "B00000DMAX", "B00005M8TL", "B00000INR2", "B000046Q7Q", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00005AW1W", "B00004U1R1", "B0015OG4G4", "B00000IFRI", "B005GTNBGK", "B00004S9A7", "B00004S9AA", "B005GTNC8W", "B000JVM256", "B00000K1AF", "B00002STH5", "B00001OX4T", "B00002STGE", "B005GTND0E", "B00002970G", "B002TK1PX0", "B000PJHAD6", "B005DI7N7W", "B000038A6U", "B000YOCGUO", "B003UI5GLC", "B0009Y808Q", "B00002STI2", "B00005ME6D", "B00005AQRH", "B00001QES1", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000QHOHHE", "B00000JHPD", "B000046S41", "B000F9JFXE", "B000050FAE", "B00004U1QX", "B00004R9I4", "B00002STHX", "B00000DMAO", "B00002970H", "B00002STF6", "B0046CZX78", "B007SJMEHI", "B00003E4EB", "B00002STGT", "B00000J2OO", "B00004U1R0", "B00001QERY", "B00000I1BE"], "bought_together": ["B00002STFH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00002STFH", "B00002STH0", "B002TK1PX0", "B00000F1GM"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5445}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64"]]}
