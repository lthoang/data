{"asin": "B00004YZQ8", "description": "The Canon EF 28-105mm standard zoom lens retains the optical capability of Canon's previous EF 28-105mm USM lens but with a refined exterior design. The lens is distinguished by a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM) drive that provides silent, high-speed autofocusing, along with full-time manual focusing. The 1.6-foot close-focusing distance, meanwhile, lets you take great close-up portraits and nature shots. A good match for the Canon EOS A2/A2e or ELAN 7 series cameras with built-in flashes, the EF 28-105mm lens is an excellent zoom lens for everyday use. The lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 28-105mmMaximum aperture: 1:3.5-4.5Lens construction: 15 elements in 12 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 75 to 23 degrees (at 30 feet)Focus adjustment: Inner focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 1.6 feetZoom system: Rotating typeFilter size: 58mmDimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter, 3 inches longWeight: 13.2 ounces", "title": "Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras", "price": 479.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5EXYJP9L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K42W46", "B00004ZCJI", "B003WD2SLQ", "B00BW6LW7G", "B00005K47X", "B001G5ZTLS", "B000V5K3FG", "B00007E7JU", "B00007GQLU", "B003SQEAY0", "B0040JHVCC", "B000FW1X4K", "B001WB02Z4", "B007N83VQM", "B00007B4DM", "B004UTQRHW", "B002ZIMEMW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006I53S", "B00007E7JU", "B00004THAU", "B00004ZCJI"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses", "Camera Lenses", "Digital Camera Lenses"]]}
