{"asin": "B00004TC6E", "description": "Chrono Cross, the sequel to the Super Nintendo classicChrono Trigger, turns out to be well worth the wait. Taking off  20 years after the first game,Chrono Crossfollows a boy named  Serge across parallel worlds--both the world in which he lives and one  in which he drowned 10 years earlier.Chrono Crosswill wow players with beautiful prerendered graphics  and a unique battle system. Elements replace magic and items in battle,  and using the same element three times in a row will ultimately increase  your power. In addition to using elements, the accuracy of physical  attacks is determined by probability, with easier-to-land weak attacks  setting up fierce blows.The plot, while a bit slow to develop, is full of interesting  characters. Players will need to travel between the two worlds to  advance the plot. While many of these areas will initially appear to  look similar, you'll find them to be quite different upon closer  examination of the details. For instance, a plant that is extinct in one  world thrives in the other.My only qualm withChrono Crossis that, despite the complexities  of the battle system, veterans will have an easy time with early  battles. Still, there's much to like about this SquareSoft epic.--Robb GuidoPros:Lavish, vibrantly colored graphicsUnique battle system involving elements and casting away  role-playing clich&eacute;s like experience and magic pointsCons:Easy battles due to powerful offensive and cure elementsFor hours, players will be saying, \"Get to the time travel stuff\"", "price": 47.11, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iVctuK7AL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LOXE", "B00004Y57G", "B00002R28C", "B00008RUYZ", "B0000296O5", "B00004S9AF", "B000038IFX", "B00000JRSB", "0744000009", "B000038ABO", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00002SVWG", "B00004SPW9", "B0015MMN6G", "B000F5IH2I", "B00005BW7Q", "B00005TNI6", "B000K6TOK6", "B00004W4QJ", "B0002GTFIK", "B00004XMRL", "B00004S9AC", "B00005MA97", "B00001X50M", "B000006OVE", "B0014CN2H6", "B00004U4R4", "B00004XOWT", "B000IONGU4", "B00007KQC1", "B00008URUA", "B0009A4EV2", "B000FDOTIQ", "B000637T7S", "B00002SVX5", "B00001XDUB", "B00024W1U6", "B00008KTRS", "B00004SWM0", "B000034DMG", "B001C6GVI6", "B00001OWYW", "B0045U4U52", "B00000K39I", "B00000IM2T", "B001CM0PJ6", "B0015IXKSK", "B00004YRQA", "B0002CHJAA", "B000G7X5MM", "B000784XG2", "B00002STPG", "B000034DBS", "B000G7X5P4", "B000G82R20", "B00001ZWMV", "B00006LEMK", "B000038AAN", "B001E27DLM", "B00019HNNC", "B00002STPF", "B00000I1BY", "B0019LMXAY", "B00001ZUGT", "B00000I1C1", "B0001XAO4S", "B000TLU67W", "B00002SWCJ", "B0009XBWY6", "B00008G97F", "B003YVK5T8", "B001TOMR6Q", "B00005T7ZN", "B00000K1VE", "B0019SY1D4", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1C0", "B0009A4ETY", "B007CSF3GO", "B0032RDXHA", "B00000I1BF", "B007UHQO6A", "B00000I1BR", "B000066TS5", "B000B69E9G", "1566867142", "B000SSPH3E", "B000LWRMHQ", "B000034DC2", "0744000734", "B00004U4R9", "B000R37S78", "B00000K2X5", "B00029QQNY", "B00HPU96FI", "B00000I1BQ", "B002I0J4AM", "B002EE7OKE", "B001QTW2GY", "B00006IJJK"], "bought_together": ["B00004Y57G", "B00002R28C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y57G", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005LOXE", "B00002R28C"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 113}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
