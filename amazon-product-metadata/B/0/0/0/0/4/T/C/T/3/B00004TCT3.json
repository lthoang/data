{"asin": "B00004TCT3", "description": "Featuring a new adventure that's filled with numerous enhancements and  innovations, this long-awaited sequel toPok&eacute;mon Red,Blue,  andYellowgreatly improves upon the series' winning formula, and makes  for an even more insanely addictive and wholly absorbing gaming experience.LikePok&eacute;mon Gold--which essentially is the same story, with minor  gameplay variations--Pok&eacute;mon Silvercasts players in the familiar  role of a young Pok&eacute;mon Trainer who's out to collect as many different  kinds of Pok&eacute;mon as possible. As in previous games, gameplay consists  mostly of exploration (completing various quests in the process) and  Pok&eacute;mon battles, which employ a unique battle system that's like a  complex twist on rock-paper-scissors.But, despite the similarities, it's quite apparent thatPok&eacute;mon  Silveris a whole new ball game from the start. The game is played out in  real time, with the current time and day of the week (recorded by an internal  clock) having a direct impact on gameplay elements, such as what Pok&eacute;mon  you'll find in the wild, and when certain events occur and characters appear.While there are too many new and improved features inPok&eacute;mon  Silverto list here, among the highlights are 100 new Pok&eacute;mon  (including two new types), new evolution processes (including breeding), and a  more streamlined game interface that has better-organized menus and button  shortcuts.Although it's easier to progress inPok&eacute;mon Silverthan in the  previous games, the sheer amount of fun and game time that's involved is  daunting. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better value than this one.--Joe  HonPros:Insanely addictive and wholly absorbing gaming experienceTime and day of week impact gameplay directlyBevy of new features and hidden secretsImproved graphics and more streamlined game interfaceCons:Minor compatibility issues when using Game Link with previous versions", "price": 257.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NdJfTWv-L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LBHM", "B00000IYER", "B00000IYEQ", "B000047GEI", "B00AYQRGFW", "B0000296ZK", "B00000J97G", "B0000296ZM", "B00002ST5L", "B00AYBVB44", "B004IXQISS", "B000046S41", "B00000J9J9", "B0002TB4CW", "B00005B8G1", "B0000296ZJ", "B002CJ8Z04", "B000VBB69M", "B00002AH2U", "B000031KJL", "B000F8GWH2", "B0000A9Y11", "B009I6SH16", "B00005B8G2", "B000058BCU", "B00005B8G3", "B00GKL905O", "B000084314", "B00DTCWNL0", "B0000296ZL", "B000087PM3", "B0006GBD04", "1930206046", "B004IXJ7ZE", "B000087H7T", "B00002SVEO", "B00D3IKP7Y", "B00DTCYCAU", "B000035XB0", "B000046S40", "B0006SSR24", "B004X3XJGW", "B00002ST3U", "B0019R361I", "B00003OTI3", "B00005ATSM", "B0006GBCZU", "B000065SQ9", "B00000IWYT", "B000B5MV6A", "B00005OLW8", "B00002ST28", "B00028S9P8", "B000R08L7M", "B00002EIZW", "B000Y8EUVI", "B000059S79", "B00GQCZF88", "B00005J53A", "B0038MTE7C", "B005NQ48ZO", "0761522824", "B00DODCWMY", "B000YTYBBG", "B00005MDZY", "B00005ATSN", "B00002R108", "B008216WOW", "0761530843", "B00002ST3E", "B00005B8FZ", "B00009WAUO", "B00068O278", "B00002SVES", "B00005UK88", "B000EGDEJY", "B000A37FS2", "B004EW2PC6", "B00004TNM8", "B0038MVFYC", "0761542566", "B000A3I9XW", "0761547088", "B0023ZJMZY", "B004I8IAR0", "B009I6FWOQ", "0761522778", "B001O1OBFY", "B000GLHQJG", "B003G5UGL4", "B00003L9KV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000IYER", "B000047GEI", "B00005LBHM", "B00000IYEQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1491}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Color", "Games"]]}
