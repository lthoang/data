{"asin": "B00004ZCP0", "description": "Fine-tuning the white-knuckled car chase formula of its predecessor,Driver 2features more of the same high-speed, inner-city vehicular  mayhem, and casts players once again as Tanner, a hard-boiled undercover cop  who's posing as a badass getaway driver--this time, to stop an international mob  war.With computer-animated cinematic sequences doing the lion's share of the  storytelling, players must guide Tanner through more than 40 action-packed  missions in four different city settings, this time on foot--which primarily  allows Tanner to carjack other vehicles--as well as behind the wheel.While it can be of a lot of fun to play,Driver 2is no joy ride. The  missions can be quite unforgiving and require many restarts to complete, and the  cops are quite determined--even at the \"Easy\" setting. Also, the game's coarse,  choppy 3-D graphics often get in the way of things, with slowdowns disrupting  the game's pace, and buildings and such popping up out of nowhere.--Joe  HonPros:Drive like a bat out of hell in four different city settingsAction now takes place on foot, as well as behind the wheelOne- and two-player minigames add replay value\"Film director\" option lets players edit their own car-chase sequencesCons:Missions can be quite unforgiving--requiring many restarts to completeCoarse, choppy 3-D graphics make gameplay more difficult than it needs to be", "price": 29.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KHFD9PV9L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000034DMT", "B0000TSR4C", "B000034DC7", "B0015MMN6G", "B000K6TOK6", "B00000DMAV", "B000034DC6", "B00000DMAU", "B0045L3SNQ", "B000637T7S", "B00000I1BR", "B00004XOWT", "B00005JY66", "B00000K2X5", "B00001ZUL7", "B000PWAAAI", "B000CSUKZ0", "B00005MA97", "B00000DMAR", "B00004UG9A", "B00000I1C0", "B00002R28F", "B00001X50M", "B00000DMB6", "B00000I1BQ", "B00000I1BF", "B001TEYMRI", "B000038ABJ", "B000038ABK", "B000034DCF", "B00005NISJ", "B00005O0I2", "B00002R28M", "B00004W4QS", "B00005ML10", "B00000I1C1", "B00004U4R8", "B00000K1VE", "B00004YZAO", "B0001VGFK2", "B00004TEXU", "B00006Z7HU", "B000038A77", "B00004YRQ9", "B00001QHW9", "B00000DMB4", "B0000C7GHG", "B000021Y5P", "B000034DMG", "B00000IZ8A", "B0002IQCSY", "B0000696CZ", "B000088KH5", "B000006RGR", "B000006P0K", "B0015IXKSK", "B00000IODY", "B00005NN7B", "B00003E4G9", "B000006RGS", "B00004R8XR", "B0000A8VBZ", "B000AOEUPC", "B000TLU67W", "B001MW91IW", "B00004TBGT", "B0000A92KX", "B00005V6BE", "B00004ZEEH", "B00000K1VA", "B0009351R0", "B003O65TXU", "B00002STJO", "B00000JHPN", "B00DNVYDZG", "B00005NPXY", "B00008DHNL", "B00004YRQA", "B00001QED2", "B00006GSO0", "B000SEU92W", "B0019LMXAY", "B00006F2ZP", "B00006JC46", "B00005OLX1", "B000G7YX14", "B0000A0MDV", "B000038ABQ", "B00003W869", "B0000C4M22", "B000EMJA3M", "B000038I9K", "B000083JTR", "B000RHZJK2", "B000038ABM", "B00004W4S4", "B00001QEEC", "B0000A03AI"], "bought_together": ["B000034DMT"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003O65TXU", "B000034DMT", "B00000DMAV", "B0000TSR4C"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4889}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
