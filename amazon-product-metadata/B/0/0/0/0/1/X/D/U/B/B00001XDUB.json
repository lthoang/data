{"asin": "B00001XDUB", "description": "A downright creepy \"survival horror\" title,Silent Hillsucceeds where mostResident Evil-inspired titles suck: keeping  you hooked and instilling you with fear throughout the game. Players  are cast as Harry Mason in his desperate search for his daughter, who  mysteriously disappeared after their car crashed into a gully outside  of a desolate resort town.The 3-D environments inSilent Hillare bathed in fog or  darkness, making its dismal setting all the more eerie; this also  allows for some spectacular lighting effects when using a flashlight in  the dark. Granted, there are some pretty coarse graphics being obscured  here, but it's a fair trade-off, considering the game's short load  times.Silent Hillis played from a third-person perspective, viewed  from both fixed and moving camera angles. As with similar games, the  viewpoint can be awkward at times, especially during combat, which here  is so clunky that you should try to avoid it whenever possible--something  you should do anyway, as this isn'tTomb Raider.Rather than resort to cheap scare tactics,Silent Hillfeatures  a gameplay twist that works very well with its limited visibility  environments. Harry carries a radio with him that crackles with static  whenever the game's nasties are near, and continues until they're no  longer in the vicinity or have been killed off. (Enemies may require  further whacking when they're down, as they like to play dead.)  Additionally, the supported Dual-Shock controller pulsates in a  heartbeatlike fashion whenever you're moderately or seriously injured.--Joe HonPros:Suspenseful story with bone-chilling gameplayShort load timesExcellent lighting and fog effectsFive possible endings add replay valueCons:Coarse graphicsClunky combat", "price": 174.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BoA0xXsaL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005ME6O", "B00007LV7Y", "B0001Y7404", "B0011BE3KA", "B00000I1BY", "B000034DMG", "B000038ABO", "B00001X50M", "B00000K1VE", "B00000K1VA", "B00008DWT6", "B0019LMXAY", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005V9NH", "B00001OWYW", "B00004W4QJ", "B00005ME6N", "7561321074", "B00005MA97", "B000006RGR", "B00004XOM1", "B0050SXAIG", "B0000657SP", "B002CZ7FW2", "B0000296O5", "B00149MEWI", "B00000JRSB", "B00000I1BJ", "B0015MMN6G", "B000K6TOK6", "B00004SPW9", "B00004TC6E", "B0001NBNGG", "B0000AI1KK", "B003O6G47U", "B000006RGS", "B00001ZWMV", "B00000DMB4", "B005EZ5GNW", "B00000I1BK", "B00005Q8M4", "B00001ZUGT", "B000038IFX", "B00000IODY", "B00004WFRN", "B0009UC6AI", "B00004Y57G", "B00004XOWT", "B000637T7S", "B00000I1C0", "B0009I6S0O", "B00000I1BT", "B00007KQC5", "B000B69E9G", "B00001ZT9E", "B00006LELI", "B0000TSRA6", "B00004WMVL", "B00005ML10", "B0001Y73YQ", "B00005BW7M", "B00002SVWG", "B00000JHPN", "B002CZ3SLO", "B000HKIPGE", "B00004U1R6", "B00005RKO7", "B00000JNHJ", "B00002R28C", "B0000A09EM", "B00007KQC4", "B0007L8GPI", "B00002STJN", "B000CBCVFE", "B00149MEVY", "B00000I1C1", "B0000A8VBZ", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BQ", "B000BXKA38", "B001383L36", "B00004YRQA", "B00001ZUL7", "B00004WKHO", "B000059Z7Q", "B00002STJO", "B00002SWCJ", "B00004S9AF", "B00004RBQX", "B00005LOXE", "B00004U62A", "B00KWF38AW", "B00002STPE", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00004YRQ9", "B00002R28F", "B003O6HDHA"], "bought_together": ["B0001Y7404"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ME6O", "B005EZ5GNW", "B00000I1BY", "B0045L3SNQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4752}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
