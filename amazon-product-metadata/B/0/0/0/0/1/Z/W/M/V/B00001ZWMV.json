{"asin": "B00001ZWMV", "description": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reavertells the story of Raziel, one of the undead lieutenants of the vampire lord Kain. Jealous of Raziel's newly evolved wings, Kain tears them apart and casts his former champion into the netherworld. But a powerful entity that dwells in the netherworld has restored Raziel to a semblance of life and has set him on a path of vengeance.After this tantalizing movie introduction, you take control of Raziel in the spectral realm, where your new existence is explained to you. From there you enter the physical plane, ready to begin your quest for power and revenge. Raziel's combat moves are extremely brutal, as you'd expect from a vampire who has returned from the dead. When he finds a spear, Raziel gleefully stabs and slashes before he impales his foe, lifts it off the ground, and feasts on its soul. Doing so enhances Raziel's power, and devouring the souls of the rest of Kain's lieutenants is the only way to get the special abilities--scaling walls, phasing through gates, etc.--needed to reach Kain himself. While fun for adults, parents should take note: this game is definitelynotsuitable for kids.--John CockingPros:Agile, fluid character animation and combat movesBeautiful sceneryThe Soul Reaver (think \"vampiric lightsaber\")Ability to glide using the tattered remnants of Raziel's wingsCons:Convoluted topographySometimes awkward camera anglesLack of direction", "price": 58.69, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514CWHGi4qL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B70K", "B00002STPE", "B00009YEK1", "B00000I1BK", "B00001X50M", "B000006RGS", "B00000K1VE", "B000K6TOK6", "B00000DMAR", "B000038ABO", "B00000JHPN", "B00001XDUB", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00004TC6E", "B00001OWYW", "B0000296O5", "B0015MMN6G", "B00000JNHJ", "B00000I1BY", "B00004Y57G", "B00000I1BR", "B00004W4QJ", "B00005MA97", "B000034DMG", "B00004SPW9", "B00000K2X5", "B00000I1BF", "B00000JRSB", "B00000I1BQ", "B00000IODY", "B00000I1BG", "0761517960", "B000034DCF", "B00000I1BZ", "B00005LOXE", "B00000DMB4", "B00002STJO", "B00004S9AF", "B00001QER9", "B000006RGQ", "B00002SWCJ", "B00002STJN", "B000034DMT", "B00002SVWG", "B000029706", "B000006RGR", "B000021Y5P", "B000038IFX", "B00000I1C0", "B0001A86EG", "B00002R28C", "B00008RUYZ", "B000034DC2", "B00001QHW9", "B001TEYMRI", "B00004R9IG", "B0019LMXAY", "B00004TBGT", "B00000K1VA", "B00004U5VK", "B00004S9AD", "B00019HNNM", "B00005YVTX", "B00001ZUGT", "B00002STIW", "B00001ZULK", "B00000I1BS", "B00000I1C1", "B000006P0K", "B00004YRQA", "B00004YRQ9", "B0002XL3BA", "B00001ZT59", "B00004XOWT", "B00000I1BO", "B0000A09EM", "B000038AAN", "B000038ABK", "B00004R8XR", "B000034DC6", "B00002SVMG", "B00004TEXU", "B00005Y402", "B00000IZ8A", "B00005Q8M4", "B00019HNNC", "B00000K39I", "B00000JGAR", "B00000DMAV", "B000059Z7Q", "B00004KHAE", "B00004W4QS", "B00007UHPJ", "B00004WFRN", "B00000IMNB", "B00006AN1F", "B00002R28F"], "bought_together": ["B00005B70K", "B00002STPE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B70K", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00009YEK1", "B00004Y57G"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 13213}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
