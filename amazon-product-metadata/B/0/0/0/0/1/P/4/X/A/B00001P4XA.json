A detachable, extrawide headband  makes these Koss-termed \"stereophones\" easy to carry or store.For accurate sound reproduction, these earbud-style headphones are made with  oxygen-free copper voice coils and neodymium iron boron magnets. You can enjoy  them with either a portable or home audio device, since both 0.125-inch and  0.25-inch adapter jacks are included.\"The Plug\" weighs a mere quarter ounce and has a frequency response rated at an  impressive 16 to 23,000 Hz (though its unlikely you'll hear bass output anywhere  close to what you'd get from a similarly rated loudspeaker!).Impedance is 16 ohms, with less than a 0.3 percent distortion and reasonably  high sensitivity of 112 dB SPL/1 mW.", "title": "Koss 'The Plug' In-Ear Headphones (Black)", "price": 9.4, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LMPJXuJ-L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Koss", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001S0NTMC", "B001QWLTYM", "B000E36R9G", "B00001P4ZH", "B008I37FWC", "B0006B486K", "B003ZL93LI", "B001D6ZACI", "B00001P505", "B007Z1CXPC", "B000O2KIMO", "B003X1BEKI", "B00005N9D2", "B002MAPT7U", "B00006JILE", "B00001P4XH", "B000GU5IUQ", "B0055QOKC8", "B004W7HEMO", "B00005N9D3", "B005VP9M8A", "B0038W0K2K", "B001EZYMF4", "B0037M62KA", "B005VEZ58C", "B001EZUQ5E", "B002RL8FCU", "B004YDMRBO", "B005K925UO", "B00FB463E2"], "bought_together": ["B00001P4ZH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003EM8008", "B001S0NTMC", "B001QWLTYM", "B004W7HEMO"]}}
