Equally well  suited for use at work or on a jogging trail, the SportaPro's open, foam-covered  ear cups allow for ambient environmental sounds to be heard, which can be  helpful in a recreational environment.The SportaPro's weight is a mere 2.2 ounces, and the headphones boast a  frequency response of 15 to 25,000 Hz, delivering (on paper, at least) quite a  bit more bass than most home speakers can. Impedance is 60 ohms, with less than  a 0.2 percent distortion and sensitivity of 103 dB SPL (with a 1 mW signal).The SportaPro stereophones are collapsible and come with a carrying case, as  well as both 0.125-inch and 0.25-inch jacks. Koss covers the headphones with a  lifetime warranty.", "title": "Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones", "price": 22.9, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4199UKo21JL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Koss", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000O2KIMO", "B0006B486K", "B00001P4ZH", "B0002KQZJS", "B003CJTR8M", "B00007056H", "B006QR8W6K", "B004Z0UMVI", "B00001P4XH", "B00J94L9V2", "B00001P4XA", "B00GC8TQZ4", "B0015AFVBC", "B003X1DE88", "B00006JILE", "B004HIN97M", "B005FVNGRS", "B0002BAU84", "B005ZMF6RU", "B00E0C2XUY", "B0074EUKDM", "B00005N9D3", "B004JRYLG4", "B002VPDOH8", "B008SBZEB8", "B00004T8R2", "B00DCE3G5C", "B002ODQJKQ", "B002MAPS6W", "B000UW1MBY"], "bought_together": ["B000O2KIMO", "B0006B486K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003CJTR8M", "B00001P4ZH", "B0006B486K", "B0015AFVBC"]}}
