{"asin": "B000089GN2", "description": "Amazon.com Product Description Portable audio takes on fresh life with quality headphones, and Sennheiser's folding, lightweight, closed-ear PXC 250 is designed to keep outside noises out and headphone sound in--perfect for use in busses and libraries alike.Increase the peace! The PXC 250 features a noise reduction unitthat cancels out background noise.When engaged, NoiseGard active noise reduction drops steady-state low-frequency noise (from about 500 Hz and below) by 15 dB--which the human ear perceives as more than halving the noise--thus enhancing the clarity of your music. The noise reduction circuit requires 2 AAA batteries (not included), but the headphones work fine without the circuit engaged.Sennheiser's fold and flip design lets you turn the ear pieces 90 degrees and fold the headphones closed. Their ported design lets them move more air for greater bass response.What's in The Box6-foot Kevlar-reinforced cord, .25-inch stereo adapter, airline adapter, belt pouch.", "title": "Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones", "price": 119.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415nbLI4ggL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00375MWE2", "B002SSO06M", "B000OMKR8E", "B000R2PC2M", "B000E6G9RI", "B002HWJT1A", "B000KQQUQW", "B0031RG832", "B00372YKMM", "B000U07C1U", "B004HD4L1U", "B002VPDOHS", "B001EYU3L2", "B000N385QK", "B005EIVL5G", "B004ZLV02C", "B007SY4QTW", "B00DOP3KBY", "B004K09H32", "B00FYWCL2E", "B00BSXRBGE", "B005FVDTAW", "B0002T3UQ0", "B005EIVKLQ", "B004ZLUZOG", "B006K557BQ", "B003WV8PKG", "B002VPDOH8", "B005EIVL74", "B003WV7890", "B001VPN4R4", "B005YR0X4W", "B00915OV1E", "B009A6CZ3A", "B009A6D1NI", "B004P7O26W", "B007G95FJE", "B000NOR89Y", "B003C0GTH8", "B000AP05BO", "B004LY1LJA", "B001EYU3LC", "B000MPNUE6", "B007KWLF5K", "B001786D5A", "B000065BPB", "B00BPIYIBS", "B0035MDZKM", "B00004Z6Q6", "B004Z57YJQ", "B0002K6Y9E", "B007K3SB6K", "B002LK2QJK", "B000051SD1", "B003VIXT38", "B005N8W1MO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00375MWE2", "B004K09H32", "B004K09H32", "B005EIVKLQ", "B001EYU3L2"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Headsets & Microphones"]]}
