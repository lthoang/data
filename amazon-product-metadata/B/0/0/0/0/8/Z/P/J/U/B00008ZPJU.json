It features 802.11g technology that makes accessing files and networked peripherals-such as hard drives, printers, CD-ROMs, and DVDs-easier than ever. 802.11g technology provides you with networking speeds nearly five times faster than the current Wi-Fi (802.11b) standard. An integrated, 4-port 10/100Base-T Ethernet switch also allows you to connect wired computers to the network. 802.11g technology is the easiest wireless network to implement. The Router uses the wireless 802.11g 2.4GHz standard to offer you 400 feet of wireless coverage. 802.11g technology is backward compatible with the 802.11b Wi-Fi networking standard, so it allows you to implement faster wireless technologies in combination with existing 802.11b Wi-Fi networks.AdvantagesCreates a network in your home or office without cablesOffers backward-compatibility with all 802.11b devicesSets up easily with Belkin Easy Install Wizard-automatically detects Internet settings and self-adjusts Router to get you online in under 3 minutesEnsures data and network security with wireless 64- and 128-bit WEP encryptionWorks with Macintosh. and PC computersPackage ContentsWireless-G router, power supply, user manual, quick installation guide, RJ-45 networking cable, software CD", "title": "Belkin Wireless-G Router DSL/Cable Gateway", "price": 24.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4114978RZ4L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001CN9K6E", "B004N6259G", "B005CUVPMK", "B004N6259Q", "B004N625AA", "B004N625AK", "B004N625A0", "B008BGYJSO", "B000WGZCI2", "B008982LD4", "B001CEYYFK", "B00005ARK3", "B00004SB92", "B006SVV6HG", "B009BNEBK2", "B001UI4RTG", "B0045HHTGW", "B0045HG53K", "B00BHJWBEQ", "B008982LFW", "B004U6NS5Y", "B00JY4QCJQ", "B00C4OAPBE", "B0050SLU6K", "B004T9RR6I", "B0041LYY6K", "B0001MQSB2", "B00006B9H9", "B0085WN7YQ", "B001FWYGJS", "B0051AB60M", "B001CN7EQ2", "B0083P4SIE", "B007KZQM9G", "B003NZSX7G", "B0009EFRT6", "B00BJMZAUS", "B000QD7B6W", "B000BTL0OA", "B004H1PMJC", "B0044YU60M", "B007IL764W", "B0000D8HK1", "B00GG533L6", "B008IFXQIW", "B002WBX7TQ", "B00007KDVI", "B00006HYKM", "B00008SCFL", "B00KFD0O9E", "B001V72S06", "B005HIU29O", "B002HWRJY4", "B00DLUVH62", "B004CYF0VE", "B0028N6VNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001UI4RTG", "B00A3YN0Z0", "B001CN9K6E", "B001FWYGJS"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Cables & Interconnects"]]}
