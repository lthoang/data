You can transfer your home movies from VHS or 8 mm cassettes, back-up computer hard drives and large files, or stuff them chock full of MP3 music files and JPEG image files from your digital camera.Rewritable \"plus\" discs require no finalizing--you can record, eject, and play them with minimal fuss, thanks to \"background formatting.\" This feature, which lowers total burning time, is an advantage over the \"dash\" formats. For PC users, DVD+RW also offers advantages over DVD-RW, including on-disc content editing, built-in defect management, and multisession writing.What's in the Box25 DVD+RW discs, 1 two-piece storage case, and a paper insert with product details."}
