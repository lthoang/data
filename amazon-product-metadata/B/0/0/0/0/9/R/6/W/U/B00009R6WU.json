This not only expands the apparent distance between the foreground and background, but brings more area into focus--a must for photographers who want vivid nature shots or crisp group shots. The lens also offers an excellent price-to-performance ratio, with a high-precision aspherical lens that minimizes distortion and other aberrations to produce sharp and high-contrast images. Light enough to serve as your standard wide-angle lens, the EF 28mm carries Canon's one-year warranty.Focal length: 28mmMaximum aperture: 1:1.8Lens construction: 5 elements in 5 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 75 degreesFocus adjustment: Overall linear extension system with AFDClosest focusing distance: 1 footFilter size: 58mmDimensions: 2.7 inches in diameter, 1.7 inches longWeight: 6.5 ouncesThe Canon EF 28mm wide-angle lens lets you capture more in the frame by broadening the angle of view and increasing the depth of field.
