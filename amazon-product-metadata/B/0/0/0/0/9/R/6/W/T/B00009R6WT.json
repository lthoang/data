{"asin": "B00009R6WT", "description": "The Canon EF 24-70mm standard zoom lens does what many pros thought couldn't be done--it replaces the L-series 28-70mm f/2.8 lens with something even better. The lens offers extended coverage to an ultra-wide-angle 24mm, making it ideal for digital as well as film shooters. The new processing unit, meanwhile, makes the autofocus (AF) faster than ever. And thanks to the two aspherical elements and a totally new UD glass element, the optics are far superior to the earlier lens. Sealed and gasketed against dust and moisture, the EF 24-70mm lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 24-70mmMaximum aperture: 1:2.8Lens construction: 16 elements in 13 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 74 to 29 degreesFocus adjustment: Front-focusing methodClosest focusing distance: 1.25 feetZoom system: Rotating typeFilter size: 77mmDimensions: 3.3 inches in diameter, 4.9 inches longWeight: 2.1 poundsThe Canon EF 24-70mm standard zoom lens does what many pros thought couldn't be done--it replaces the L-series 28-70mm f/2.8 lens with something even better.
