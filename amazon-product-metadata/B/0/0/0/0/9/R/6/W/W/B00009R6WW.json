{"asin": "B00009R6WW", "description": "Bring your subjects closer while shooting sports or wildlife with the Canon EF 300mm f/4L telephoto lens. The lens is equipped with Image Stabilizer (IS) technology, which compensates for camera shake by providing the equivalent effect of a shutter speed two stops faster. The camera provides two IS modes: Stabilizer 1, the same mode featured on the EF 75-300mm lens, and Stabilizer 2, which steadies the image during horizontal or vertical panning. The lens is also half the weight of the 300mm f/2.8L IS, with a close focus distance of 4.9 feet. And like all of Canon?s fixed focal length L-series lenses above 135mm, it?s compatible with Canon's EF 1.4x II and 2x II Extenders.SpecificationsFocal length: 300mmMaximum aperture: f/4LLens construction: 15 elements in 11 groupsAngle of view: 8 degrees @ 15 feetFocus adjustment: Rear focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 4.9 feetFilter size: 77mmDimensions: 3.7 inches in diameter and 8.7 inches longWeight: 2.6 poundsWarranty: 1 yearExcellent optics and superb handling in a compact package with Image Stabilization. The IS allows safe hand holding at shutter speeds up to two stops slower than otherwise possible--making it even more useful in low-light levels. It&iacute;s less than half the weight of the 300mm f/2.8L IS, and it focuses to an incredibly close 4.9 ft/1.5m, filling the frame with a subject the size of a postcard. Like all of Canon&iacute;s fixed focal length L-series lenses above 135mm, it&iacute;s compatible with Canon&iacute;s EF Extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.Long and FastA telephoto lens is essential to any serious photographer. For sports action, you will need a fast shutter speed and a long focal length. A large maximum aperture allows a faster shutter speed. In this telephoto lens line-up, the focal lengths range from 135mm to 300mm. If you want compactness, choose a lens with a smaller maximum aperture.", "title": "Canon EF 300mm f/4L IS USM Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras", "brand": "Canon", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414NSDXCHPL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040X4PUE", "B0000BZLBQ", "B0040X4PV8", "B002NEGTSI", "B00009R6WL", "B00004ZCJM", "B001KELVS0", "B00009USW3", "B002NEGTTW", "B004OVE188", "B00A2BWBNQ", "B002C6QC3E", "B007FH1KX2", "B0033PRWSW", "B000053HC5", "B000U8Y88M", "B000I1X3W8", "B00009R9EO", "B00009R6VZ", "B0000BZL8H", "B009EM694G", "B00JD4TQ8Q", "B007FGYZFI", "B000NP46K2", "B002O3UOUW", "B0087MZJRC", "B0000BZLAC", "B008I2175E", "B000A1SWOA", "B00009R6WO", "B004OR15LI", "B004OVE18I", "B000I1YIDQ", "B0000BZL9J", "1285084535", "B00009XVBU", "B00A2BWC08", "B009YTVFAW", "B001CCAISE", "B0000BZL83", "B007NDL56A", "B000AZ57M6", "B0083Z6R4W", "B00006I548", "B004S8GUZO", "1285422732", "B007FH1FZ0", "B002L60TTI", "B00A2BWBCM", "B00A2BWAKK", "B00009R6UI", "B0049XGNKK", "B00AO9Y1Z2", "B00004ZCI2", "B009B0MZ8U", "B004OVE18S", "B00894YP00", "1285434625", "B00DMS0GTC", "B004OVE17Y", "B0049H89F8", "B007FH1LJU", "B0000BZL68", "B0076BNK30", "B0000BZL47", "B0019CSVMW", "B000SLNNG4", "B000V5P94Q", "B000SLIJWM", "B002WE0QN8", "B0000DZ5OE", "B005Y3T1AI", "B00009XVCZ", "B002NEGTU6", "B002WR7VSS", "B00A2BWAY6", "B00BW6LVW2", "B001KBZ3S2", "B007FGZ1V0", "B002KDS2BY", "B0041L3JS4", "B007BXD66E", "B000EW9Y4M", "B000UMX7FI", "B0054ENDO2", "1594858381", "B0027JM35M", "1937538109", "B000PTFDYO", "0691117969", "B00CBQ5YOS", "B005GMWEI8", "B00009XW3O", "B00419A8P8", "032171105X", "B00007GQLU", "0618225900", "B00004XOM3", "B0043D2L6Q", "B0062W02C6"], "bought_together": ["B0000BZLBQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007GQLS", "B00009USW3", "B0040X4PUE", "B0000BZLBQ"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses", "Camera Lenses", "Digital Camera Lenses"]]}
