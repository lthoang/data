{"asin": "B00009R6WL", "description": "Multiply the focal length of your 135mm or longer lens by 1.4x without sacrificing image quality with the Canon EF 1.4x II extender. Optically superb, the lens fits all Canon 135mm fixed focal length lenses (except the 135mm f/2.8 Softfocus lens), along with the EF 70-200mm f/2.8L, 70-200mm f/2.8L, 70-200mm f/4.0L, 70-200mm f/4.0L IS USM, and 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS zoom lenses. In addition, the extender doesn't sacrifice your autofocus on any EOS camera as long as it's combined with a lens having an f/4 or faster maximum aperture (the extender reduces the effective aperture by one f-stop). Best of all, this version maintains the outstanding optics of the earlier incarnation, but adds a weather-resistant construction and improved anti-reflective surfaces in the barrel. The EF 1.4x II extender, which measures 2.9 inches in diameter and 1.1 inches long, weighs 7.8 ounces.", "title": "Canon EF 1.4X II Extender Telephoto Accessory", "price": 491.69, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21NREKZQPQL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009R6WW", "B00007GQLS", "B000053HH5", "B000I1X3W8", "B00006I53W", "B004V97MXE", "B002KDS2BY", "B000A3OF3K", "B00009R9EO", "B001KELVS0", "B0000BZLBQ", "B00006I53X", "B00007E7K1", "B00009XVBY", "B0000BZL8H", "B000053HC5", "B002NEGTSI", "B0054ENDO2", "B0000BZLAC", "B00004ZCI3", "B00DMS0GTC", "B00015CQ2E", "B0000U1N38", "B007FGYZFI", "B00009USW3", "B0071BIQZC", "B0049XGNKK", "B0076BNK30", "B0033PRWSW", "B00BBQ8IDS", "B000EW8074", "B00004WCFT", "B0040X4PQI", "B0049H89F8", "B0002Y5WXE", "B00009XVDB", "B002L60TTI", "B00004XOM3", "B00AZRGIO0", "B003UOIMAS", "B00A2BWBNQ", "B00009R6WO", "B00004ZCJM", "B004AH10K8", "B0000BZL9J", "B002WE4H8I", "B000UMX7FI", "B00DCY29G4", "B002N694A6", "B007FH1KX2", "B0089INHZ0", "B009B0MZ8U", "B00017LSPI", "B002WR7VSS"], "bought_together": ["B00009R6WW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0040X4PUE", "B002C6QC3E", "B00009R6WW", "B0000BZLBQ"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Accessories", "Lens Accessories", "Adapters & Converters"]]}
