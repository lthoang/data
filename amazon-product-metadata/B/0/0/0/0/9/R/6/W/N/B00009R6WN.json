{"asin": "B00009R6WN", "description": "Love the fisheye effect? Turn to the Canon EF 15mm fisheye lens, which offers an ultra-wide 180-degree angle of view for capturing scenes well beyond your natural field of vision. As with all fisheye lenses, the 15mm provides a ton of unique and interesting effects, with a minimum focusing distance of 8 inches giving new meaning to close-up shots. Best of all, the lens is tack-sharp throughout its entire focus range. The lens--which includes a fixed petal-type hood and a built-in rear filter holder that holds up to three gel filters at once--carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 15mm fisheyeMaximum aperture: f/2.8Lens construction: 8 elements in 7 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 180 degreesFocus adjustment: Overall linear extension system with AFDClosest focusing distance: 0.7 feetFilter size: Rear gel holder (accepts up to 3 precut gel filters)Dimensions: 2.9 inches in diameter, 2.4 inches longWeight: 11.6 ounces", "title": "Canon EF 15mm f/2.8 Fisheye Lens for Canon SLR Cameras", "price": 609.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X5FsSCzYL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007FH1KX2", "B00004ZCK0", "B002NEGTTW", "B001CCAISE", "B006G5ZVA2", "B00009XVCZ", "B007FGYZFI", "B001KELVS0", "B000NP3DJW", "B002NO7PWC", "B005DEHVC8", "B002ZIMEMW", "B002XDQIWQ", "B00004WCID"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CDC79M", "B00007E7JU", "B002LTXQUE", "B00007GQLU"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses", "Camera Lenses", "Digital Camera Lenses"]]}
