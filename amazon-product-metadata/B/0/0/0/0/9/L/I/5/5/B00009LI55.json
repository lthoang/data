{"asin": "B00009LI55", "description": "Sennheiser's lightweight, open-ear PMX60s are tailor-made for portable listening and specifically designed for rock and pop music, with a high maximum playback level (122 dB SPL), low distortion (under .5 percent), and a dedicated bass tube to heighten musical impact through additional low-frequency resonance. (Keep in mind that even though the headphones perform at loud levels, your ears will surely deteriorate through extended loud listening.) The PMX60s' comfy neckband design prevents the dreaded \"headphone hair,\" and their three-foot cord grants extended freedom of movement.What's in the BoxHeadphones only.", "title": "Sennheiser PMX 60 Lightweight Portable Headphones with Neckband (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 64.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FH33XFN9L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DZIQRXI", "B00DV4B9IO", "B003CJTR8M", "B0015AFVBC", "B0001IVB1S", "B0019UX796", "B0074EUKDM", "B0094R4Q6Y", "B0006B486K", "B0015AFONW", "B005FVNH04", "B00001P505", "B0034L3G8U"], "bought_together": ["B003CJTR8M", "B0015AFVBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003CJTR8M", "B00DZIQRXI", "B0015AFVBC", "B002BH3I9U"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Headsets & Microphones"]]}
