Described as \"Hands down the best-sounding center speaker I've ever heard\" by a reviewer atHome Theater Magazine, the DV-62CLRS boasts a combination of state-of-the-art component circuitry, three high-quality drivers, dual vents, and a unique crossover design to produce extremely lifelike sound and imaging. The speaker is built around two 6-inch polypropylene/graphite woofers and a 0.75-inch poly dome tweeter, which team to produce an extremely wide (for a center speaker) 38 Hz to 20 kHz frequency response. As a result, dialogue sounds rich and fluid, giving your DVD soundtracks added depth. Additional specs include a sensitivity rating of 90 dB, a 3.5 kHz crossover, and 8-ohm impedance.The DV-62CLRS is compatible with a variety of amps, with a recommended power rating of 10 to 175 watts per channel. Listeners will also appreciate the speaker's attractive design, which features a relatively slim profile and a black laminate finish. For surround applications, the speakers perform particularly well when matched with other BIC America models, which are tonally matched to deliver a balanced audio profile. The company recommends using its DV84 tower speakers for the front channels, a pair of DV62si bookshelf speakers for the rear channels, and the V1215 subwoofer for top-level bass performance. All the speakers in the DV line are magnetically shielded to prevent video interference when located near a TV or monitor.The speaker measures 20 by 7.65 by 10 inches (W x H x D) and carries a generous seven-year limited warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxDV-62CLRS center speaker, warranty card, user's manual."}
