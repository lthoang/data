{"asin": "B00009MVJ7", "description": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub", "price": 116.6, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1GWWZNL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005Q8IR", "B0007CGBDG", "B0000CDZBC", "B000189K3E", "B00004U5VI", "B00005UNWC", "B00065676U", "B000TLU67W", "0761543856", "B0009R1SZ0", "B00004YRQ9", "B00006Z7HR", "9629971372", "B00004YRQA", "B00066LGEM", "B00009U146", "B0002GTFIK", "B00002SVWG", "B0009O7HVW", "B0000C7GHG", "B000F5IH2I", "B0001A86EG", "B000TGQLYE", "B00007KQC1", "B0001I9YHG", "B0009A4EV2", "B0002SQ0AY", "B00005TNI6", "B001MW91IW", "B00021KEPI", "B000088KH9", "B00004ZDFY", "B000G82R20", "0782129889", "B000FDOTIQ", "B00005Q8M4", "B0009A4EVM", "B00KAEITQ8", "B00006LEM8", "B000066TS5", "B00004U5VK", "B0013KW1B2", "B00008G7DU", "B000G7X5P4", "B000IONGU4", "B000CC5CHW", "B0002IQD1U", "B000G77X34", "B0009O7HVM", "B004S3KB6S", "B000069D39", "B0009I6S0O", "B0009A4EUI", "B00009VE6D", "B0000657SQ", "B00005J536", "B00006LEMK", "B0007V63J4", "B0009VQANG", "B00008NRM9", "B00005MA97", "B000066TS3", "B0009XBWY6", "B00005MDZD", "B00019HNNC", "B00004TC6E", "B001UIG6M2", "B000G6SPHI", "B000B69E9G", "B0015ACX3Q", "B00005ME6N", "B000DZTRHE", "B0009RG8DW", "B000FGA1US", "B0002XL3BA", "B00001ZULK", "B0000A1HW9", "0744008379", "B0009Z3K9O", "0744001404", "B0009350BW", "B00000JRSB", "B00009XO59", "B00H45K6KS", "B00004Y57G", "B000CSUKY6", "B000094M46", "B000009QCW", "B00019HNNM", "B00000JNHJ", "B000NGQ26C", "B00006GSNZ", "B000034DMG", "B000G7X5OK", "B0000A03AI", "B0013JHKU0", "B000069BD9", "B0000664J5", "B00005MDZ1"], "bought_together": ["B00005Q8IR", "B0000CDZBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005Q8IR", "B0000CDZBC", "B00009U146", "B0007CGBDG"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4836}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
