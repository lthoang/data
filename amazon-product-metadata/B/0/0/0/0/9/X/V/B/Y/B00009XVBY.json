{"asin": "B00009XVBY", "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo"]], "description": "Designed to double the focal length of any compatible Canon EF lens, the Canon EF 2x II extender telephoto accessory is ideal for sporting events and nature photography. The lens boasts a new seven-element design, along with the same weather-resistant and anti-reflective internal construction as the companion EF 1.4x II extender. More significantly, the extender supports autofocus with any EOS body provided the lens has an f/2.8 or faster maximum aperture (the EF 2x II reduces effective aperture by two stops). The EF 2x II--which also maintains an EOS camera's Image Stabilization technology--carries a one-year warranty.Magnification: 2.0xLens construction: 7 elements in 5 groupsDimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter and 2.3 inches longWeight: 9.3 ounces", "title": "Canon EF 2X II Extender Telephoto Accessory", "price": 488.89, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21G42QG1X5L.jpg", "brand": "Canon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006I53W", "B00007GQLS", "B0033PRWSW", "B0083Z6R4W", "B00004ZCJM", "B007FH1FZ0", "B001KELVS0", "B004OVE188", "B00009R6WL", "B00009R6WT", "B0000BZL9J", "B0041MY32Y", "B000I1X3W8", "B00007B4DM", "B004AH10K8", "B007FH1KX2", "B000053HBB", "B0017U0WM8", "B002TI71HQ", "B000BH5OW6", "B000L47AHG", "B000U8Y88M", "B004Z55VP0", "B0008G2GUS", "B00004XOM3", "B0049XGNKK", "B004S8GUZO", "B0093HGDVG", "B002NEGTTW", "B00B30N7AQ", "B0056TYRMW", "B0000BZLAC", "B004RBX0GO", "B009B0MZ8U", "B0075SUKIC"], "bought_together": ["B00004ZCJM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0040X4PV8", "B003Y60DZO", "B001KELVS0", "B0000BZLBQ"]}}
