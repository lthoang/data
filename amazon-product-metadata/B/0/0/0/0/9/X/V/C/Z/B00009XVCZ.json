The lens is outfitted with two high-refraction lens elements and new Gaussian optics, which combine to eliminate astigmatism and suppress astigmatic difference. As a result, the lens obtains crisp images with little flare even at the maximum aperture. The lens's f/1.4 speed, meanwhile, is perfect for available-light shooting. And as a bonus, this lens is the only lens in the EF system to offer an extra-small Micro Ultra Sonic Motor (USM) while still providing a full-time manual focusing option. Other features include a close focusing distance of 1.5 feet, a 58mm filter size, and a one-year warranty.what's in the boxCanon Normal EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Autofocus Lens, E-58U 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap, Lens Dust Cap E (Rear) and 1-Year Warranty.SpecificationsFocal length: 50mmMaximum aperture: f/1.4LLens construction: 7 elements in 6 groupsAngle of view: 46 degreesFocus adjustment: Overall linear extension system with USMClosest focusing distance: 1.5 feetFilter size: 58mmDimensions: 2.9 inches in diameter and 2 inches longWeight: 10.2 ouncesWarranty: 1 year"}
