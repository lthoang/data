{"asin": "B00000F1GM", "description": "The game that launched the Nintendo 64 system stands the test of time as one of the first and  best exploratory action/adventure games. Guide the legendary plumber through an incredibly vast magical  world with never-before-seen movement and camera-angle freedom. Mario's got the moves with graduated  speeds of running and walking, jumps, super jumps, bounce attacks, swimming, and more. The more you  play, the more moves you'll discover.This industry milestone game lets gamers play at their own pace, encouraging them to explore new nooks  and crannies of its many levels with a Zen-like approach where the journey is as important as the goal.  Other N64 games such asZelda,Banjo-Kazooie, andDonkey Kong 64all owe  much of their inspiration to this gem of a game. A showcase for the system's graphics and processing speed  capabilities,Super Mario 64is a must-have for any N64 owner.--Jeff YoungPros:Huge world makes for enduring game experiencePlenty of room for replayState-of-the-art graphics for its timeImaginative levels keep you guessing, and helpful characters act as an in-game tutorialCons:First-generation game doesn't feature as much texture or detail in graphics", "price": 299.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HJDRbM7mL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002DHEV", "B00000DMAX", "B00002STEZ", "B005GTNBGK", "B00000ID61", "B00005M8TL", "B00000J2W7", "B00000DMAQ", "B000PJHAD6", "B003UI5GLC", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00003OTI3", "B00002STH0", "B00000INR2", "B00004U1R1", "B00002STFH", "B005GTND0E", "B002TK1PX0", "B000F9JFXE", "B000YOCGUO", "B00000IFRI", "B007SJMEHI", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000QHOHHE", "B00004R9IB", "B0015OG4G4", "B00004U1QY", "B005DI7N7W", "B00003E4EB", "B00004S9AA", "B000046Q7Q", "B005GTNC8W", "B00000J2OO", "B00002STI2", "B000031KJM", "B00004S9A7", "B00000K1AF", "B00004SWLT", "B00000ID60", "B00004R9I4", "B00001WRJO", "B000021Y2Z", "B002J44BXW", "B00856304Y", "B00004U1R3", "B00000JHPD", "B00001QES1", "B000058BCU", "B000YT1VMS", "B000038A6U", "B00002SUZ5", "B000JVM256", "B00000DMAO", "B00000DMB9", "B00005AW1W", "B0046CZX78", "B00002SVFZ", "B0013KR3QA", "B00005B4Q7", "B00002STXQ", "B00004WLMA", "B00000K2G9", "B00HM3QANO", "B002TK5I6K", "B00002STHX", "B00000I1BE", "B00002ST27", "B000046S41", "B002GCK960", "B000050FAE", "B00002STH5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000DMAX", "B00002DHEV", "B00002STH0", "B000PJHAD6"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 699}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
