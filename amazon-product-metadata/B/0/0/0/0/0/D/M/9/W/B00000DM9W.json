{"asin": "B00000DM9W", "description": "The Sony Shower Mate radio may just be the ideal early-morning companion: it only plays what you want, when you want, for as long as you want. This splash-resistant TV/Weather/AM/FM synthesized radio offers five preset buttons for programming in your favorite stations, a 90-minute timer with five timer presets (great for kitchen use), and an auto-off function. The large, raised buttons that top the unit are labeled clearly for bleary-eyed mornings, and the volume control has raised grips so that it can be manipulated when fingers are wet and slippery. The Shower Mate is oval-shaped with a flat top and bottom, and is constructed of tough, white plastic. Although it's intended to be used near water, the radio shouldn't be submerged--or even subjected to the stream of a shower. Comes with a strap for hanging and a suction cup for positioning a wire antenna. Requires three C batteries for operation.", "title": "Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "price": 48.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N1GD8263L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00171MWSO", "B001VNLRPC", "B0012YFY54", "B00140DBRY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00171MWSO", "B000I3F91O", "B001VNLRPC", "B00B1YZSOC"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Home Audio", "Radios", "Shower Radios"]]}
