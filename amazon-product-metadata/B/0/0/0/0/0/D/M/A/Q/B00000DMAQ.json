{"asin": "B00000DMAQ", "description": "Banjo-Kazooiemimics the look and feel ofMario 64, a truly innovative and visually stunning game that belongs in any Nintendo 64 collection. But don't brush off this 3-D  action-adventure as an uninspired clone. On the contrary,Banjo-Kazooieintroduces more than enough originality to warrant a spot next to its famous mentor.The game introduces two of the most charming virtual heroes in recent years--the goofy, floppy honey bear, Banjo, and his faithful, feathered sidekick Kazooie. In the game's introduction, we discover that the sinister witch Gruntilda not only nabbed Banjo's sister Tooty, but stole her beauty as well. Naturally, it's up to the bear-bird team to retrieve Tooty and rid the world of one darned inconsiderate witch.In this beautifully-rendered and massive game world, players run, jump, swim, climb, and flip over obstacles, defeat all sorts of \"baddies,\" and find and collect numerous items and clues that help the quest to progress. Playing as both Banjo and Kazooie, players hone their characters' actions, learning nearly two dozen special moves that help players expertly defeat foes and successfully tread through the nine worlds.Banjo-Kazooieis one of those games that can demand hours upon hours of perseverance, patience, and learning of skills to complete. But don't let that discourage you. This epic game is so much fun that reaching the end will be an afterthought.--Eric TwelkerPros:Nicely-paced game world filled with well-designed challengesExcellent character control with numerous special movesGorgeous graphicsCons:Numerous--often complex--special moves may discourage some casual gamers", "price": 399.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CXdLRZthL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004SWLT", "B00002STEZ", "B00000F1GM", "B00002STH0", "B00000ID61", "B00002STFH", "B00002DHEV", "B00000INR2", "B00000DMAX", "B00005M8TL", "B00000J2W7", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00004U1R1", "B000031KJM", "B00004U1R3", "B00004R9IB", "B00000IFRI", "B005GTNBGK", "B000PJHAD6", "B0015OG4G4", "B002TK1PX0", "B000YOCGUO", "B00004S9AA", "B000F9JFXE", "B00003OTI3", "B00004S9A7", "B000046Q7Q", "B005DI7N7W", "B003UI5GLC", "B005GTND0E", "B000058BCU", "B000QHOHHE", "B00003E4EB", "B00002970G", "B000038A6U", "B007SJMEHI", "B00005AW1W", "B00002STI2", "B00004U1QY", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000JVM256", "B005GTNC8W", "B00002STXG", "B00002SVFV", "B00000K1AF", "B00000J2OO", "B00002SVG2", "B000050FAE", "B0009Y808Q", "B00002SVG0", "B00001WRJO", "B00001OX4T", "B00002SVFZ", "B00002STH5", "B00000DMAO", "B00000JHPD", "B00002STXN", "B00005AQRH", "B00002STGE", "B00001QES1", "B00001ZWP8", "B000021Y2Z", "B000YA6S6Q", "B00004R9I4", "B00000I1BE", "B009MRZAUC", "B00000ID60", "0761512489", "B002J44BXW", "B00AFJMFJA", "B00001QERY"], "bought_together": ["B00004SWLT", "B00002STEZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000F1GM", "B00002STEZ", "B00002DHEV", "B00002STH0"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1917}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
