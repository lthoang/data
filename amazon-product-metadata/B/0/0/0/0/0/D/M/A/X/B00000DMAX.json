{"asin": "B00000DMAX", "description": "Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats", "price": 699.94, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517qsgbi2ML._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000J2W7", "B00002DHEV", "B00000F1GM", "B005GTNBGK", "B005GTND0E", "B00002STEZ", "B005DI7N7W", "B000PJHAD6", "B00000IFRI", "B005GTNC8W", "B00002STH0", "B003UI5GLC", "B00000ID61", "B007SJMEHI", "B000QHOHHE", "B00003OTI3", "B000021Y2Z", "B00004U1QY", "B000046Q7Q", "B00000INR2", "B00000DMAQ", "B000YOCGUO", "B00004S9A7", "B00005M8TL", "B00856304Y", "B00002STFH", "B00005AW1W", "B00004R9I4", "B00000ID60", "B002TK1PX0", "B000F9JFXE", "B00000JHPD", "B000Y0CHX4", "B002J44BXW", "B0015OG4G4", "B00002STI2", "B003ZU0PHU", "B00000K1AF", "B0046CZX78", "B00004S9AA", "B00001QES1", "B00004S9A2", "B000031KJM", "B00003E4EB", "B00004U1R1", "B000058BCU", "B00002STHX", "B00000J2OO", "B00HM3QANO", "B00000K2G9", "B000046S41", "B00000DMAO", "B0009Y808Q", "B00004U1R3", "B00002SVG0", "B00HHRE23A", "B000038A6U", "B0013KR3QA", "B00002SUZ5", "B00004SWLT", "B00005AQRH", "B000JVM256", "B00000DMB9", "B00001WRJO", "B00002SVFR", "B009MRZAUC", "B00004R9IB", "B000RJOAP0", "B000B6LE1C", "B000YT1VMS", "B00KLRZBGK"], "bought_together": ["B00000J2W7"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000F1GM", "B00002DHEV", "B002TK1PX0", "B005GTNBGK"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 622}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
