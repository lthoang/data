{"asin": "B00000JRSB", "description": "Long recognized as role-playing games par excellence, theFinal  Fantasyseries gets a technological makeover in this installment (and series  debut on the PlayStation). Shedding the two-dimensional graphics and limited  sound capabilities of its predecessors,Final Fantasy VIIfeatures lush  3-D graphics, beautifully animated \"movie\" sequences, and soundtrack-quality  music. Coupled with the game's intricate storyline, endearing characters, and  immense yet highly imaginative world, these new advancements make for a quite an  engrossing experience.The story ofFinal Fantasy VIIcenters around a solider named Cloud  Strife, who joins forces with Avalanche, a group of resistance fighters, to take  down an evil mega-corporation known as Shinra. (The fate of the world hangs in  the balance, of course.) Truly epic in scope, this four-disc game requires a  considerable amount of time to complete---this reviewer gladly gave up over 80  hours of his life to finish it. But it's definitely a rewarding adventure that  every PlayStation owner should consider undertaking, especially since it's now  one of the low-priced \"Greatest Hits\" titles.--Joe HonPros:Intricate and absorbing storyline with endearing charactersImmense and highly imaginative game worldSpecial battle systemBeautifully animated movie sequencesCons:Your friends and family may feel neglected", "price": 179.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tkmb93AiL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000296O5", "B00004Y57G", "B00002R28C", "B0045L3SNQ", "1566867142", "B00002SVWG", "B00005LOXE", "B00008RUYZ", "B000K6TOK6", "B0015MMN6G", "B00004TC6E", "B00005TNI6", "B00005MA97", "B00004S9AF", "B000FDOTIQ", "B00004XOWT", "B000038ABO", "B00008URUA", "B00001X50M", "B000F5IH2I", "B000637T7S", "B000038IFX", "B000PWAAAI", "B000TLU67W", "B000034DMG", "B00001OWYW", "B00004W4QJ", "B00000K39I", "B00000DMAR", "B00004XMRL", "B000AMJG4Y", "B00000I1C1", "B00001XDUB", "B000GABOTU", "156686903X", "B007UHQO6A", "B00000K1VE", "0744000416", "B000066TS5", "B00004R9IL", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005BW7Q", "B0009A4EVM", "B00004SPW9", "B000GACEHQ", "B00004ZEEH", "B001MW91IW", "B000034DBS", "B000006OVE", "B00004TBGT", "B00004YRQA", "B00002STXN", "B0019LMXAY", "B00004U4R9", "B0014CN2H6", "0744002850", "B00005ME6O", "B00004S9AC", "0744001404", "B000006RGS", "B000784XG2", "B001C6GVI6", "B00000IM2T", "B00002STPG", "B00008KTRS", "B0002CHJAA", "B000LOAQNQ", "B00004U4R4", "B00004YRQ9", "B00000I1BF", "B00002SVX5", "B00024W1U6", "B001YYQ9SS", "B00005Q8M4", "B00000I1BT", "B0009A4EV2", "B000CC5CHW", "B00000I1BR", "B0000C7GHG", "B00009PS24", "B00001ZWMV", "B00002SV4N", "B00004SVYE", "B000038AAN", "B00000I1BY", "B0002RQ3ES", "B0032GTMEE", "B00002STPE", "B000LY4IDK", "B000SEU92W", "B00005T7ZN", "B00000JNHJ", "B000G82R20", "0761537333", "B00004ZDFY", "B00002SVYB", "B0013JHKU0"], "bought_together": ["B0000296O5", "B00004Y57G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y57G", "B0000296O5", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005TNI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2107}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
