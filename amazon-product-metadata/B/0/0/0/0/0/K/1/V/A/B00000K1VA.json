As Jill Valentine, one of the original game's survivors, players  must fight for their lives while fleeing a city overrun by hordes of zombies and  other hideous creatures mutated by a sinister corporation's biotechnological  virus. To make thing worse, a near-invincible monstrosity known as the Nemesis  stalks Jill throughout the game, which raises the series' suspense level to an  all-new high.In addition to the constant threat of the Nemesis,Resident Evil 3features other gameplay elements new to the series: players can now dodge  attacks, perform quick 180-degree turns, and create ammunition by mixing  gunpowder types. Also, the \"Live Selection\" feature forces players to make  decisions that affect the story's direction.While none of these additions are particularly groundbreaking,Resident Evil  3keeps the player in suspense and the action even more intense than in its  predecessors, proving that more of same can be a good--make that very,verygood--thing in a sequel.--Joe HonPros:Suspenseful and thoroughly engrossing storylineExcellent use of topnotch graphics and sound to establish moodImproved controls and faster load time between scenesThe Mercenaries secret game adds serious replay valueCons:Third-person, fixed-camera-angle point-of-view can be awkwardMay be too intense for younger players", "price": 249.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vHvw%2BM6mL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000034DMG", "B00000I1BY", "B00000I1BJ", "B00005ME6N", "B00000K1VE", "B00001XDUB", "B000B69E9G", "B00006LELI", "B00001X50M", "B00004WMVL", "B0000TSRA6", "B000006RGS", "B00005MA97", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00000K2X5", "B000038ABO", "B0015MMN6G", "B0019LMXAY", "B00005ME6O", "B0007L8GPI", "B00004W4QJ", "B000K6TOK6", "B0000657SP", "B00009KO3N", "B00000DMB4", "B00007LV7Y", "B00004XOM1", "B00269DXR0", "B0000296O5", "B000006P0K", "B00004XOWT", "B00000I1C1", "B000006RGR", "B00004Y57G", "B00000IODY", "B00004SPW9", "B00002R28F", "B000034DMT", "B000034DC6", "B00000DMAR", "B00002STJN", "B00004R9IG", "B004UDB9SA", "B00001ZT9E", "B00000K2G7", "B00000I1BR", "B00004TC6E", "B00269DXXO", "0671024418", "B0001Y7404", "B00002SVWG", "B00000I1BF", "B00005ML10", "B0011BE3KA", "B00001YVBL", "B000BXKA38", "B0050SXLQC", "B000TLU67W", "B000637T7S", "B00001ZWMV", "B00001OWYW", "B000021Y5P", "B00004ZEEH", "B00000JRSB", "B00005NGR0", "B000QTD05C", "B00004TEXU", "B00004S9AF", "B000034DCF", "B00000DMB6", "B00B59L9T6", "B0002XL3BA", "B0020H46D8", "B001TEYMRI", "076152617X", "B00001ZUGT", "B00019HNNC", "B00004W4QS", "0671024396", "B00000I1BQ", "B002Z7BE24", "B00000I1C0", "B000034DC7", "B00005NCCR", "B00004U1R6", "B00006BMQB", "B00008RUYZ", "B00000IXB8", "B00004YRQA", "B0002A6CQ4", "B00001QER9", "B000PWAAAI", "B000G6SPHI", "B00002R28C", "B00001QHW9", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00004U62A", "B000006RGQ"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1BY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000034DMG", "B00000I1BY", "B0019LMXAY", "B000B69E9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 3811}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
