{"asin": "B00000K1VE", "description": "Note to Parents: Realistic violence, gore, horrorAn abandoned research complex on a remote jungle  island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean  Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast ofDino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the  makers ofResident Evil.You play as Regina, a member of a four-person team sent to retrieve an expatriate scientist. Your radio man  became a midnight snack for the T.rex, so it's up to you and your two remaining teammates to explore a  dino-infested research station, rescue the scientist, call for a helicopter retrieval, and escape with your lives.  Along the way you'll uncover the grizzly remains of those who got in the dinosaurs' way, and you'll unravel  the mystery of how a top-secret energy research project turned into a Jurassic nightmare.And about those dinosaurs: they're all over the island. One instant you'll be walking along a second-story  balcony, admiring the view, the next instant you'll be dodging a T.rex as it smashes its huge maw through  the concrete walls. Velociraptors chase you down blood-spattered corridors, flying reptiles circle the  outdoor areas, and your only weapons are your pistol, whatever else you can salvage, a dwindling supply of  ammunition, and your wits.Packed with clever puzzles and heart-pounding surprises, all superbly presented with realistic graphics and  horror-movie camera angles,Dino Crisisis a triumph of survival-horror gaming.--Mike  FehlauerPros:Great sound effects and musicWell-integrated, varied, and clever puzzlesAwe-inspiring, terrifying dinosaursBranching story line improves replay valueCons:Doors impervious to explosives", "price": 36.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p9W4FOUTL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XOM1", "B000034DMG", "B000038ABO", "B00000I1BY", "B00000K1VA", "B00001XDUB", "B00001X50M", "B0019LMXAY", "B00004W4QJ", "B00005ME6N", "B00009KO3F", "0761522395", "B00000IODY", "B000006RGS", "B00004WMVL", "B00001ZUGT", "B00001ZWMV", "B0000296O5", "B0000657SP", "B00000I1BJ", "B00000DMAR", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00000I1BR", "B00008RUYZ", "B00000JHPN", "B00000JRSB", "B00002STJN", "B00004R9IG", "B00000I1BF", "B0007L8GPI", "B00004TC6E", "B000637T7S", "B001TEYMRI", "B00004Y57G", "B0015MMN6G", "B000006RGR", "B000K6TOK6", "B00004S9AF", "B0000TSRA6", "B00005LOXE", "B00000DMB4", "B00004XOWT", "B00000K2X5", "B000059Z7Q", "B0011BE3KA", "B00004SPW9", "B000067K2C", "B00004WFRN", "B0001Y7404", "B00000I1BQ", "B000021Y5P", "B00002STJO", "B000B69E9G", "B00005ML10", "B00007KQC5", "B00000JNHJ", "B000034DMT", "B00007KQC4", "B00006LELI", "B00000IKCC", "B00002R28C", "B0009XBWY6", "B00002R28F", "B00002SVX5", "B00005NGR0", "B00000I1C1", "B00009KO3N", "B00004U4R9", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00005MA97", "B00002STIW", "B0001NBNGG", "B00005ME6O", "B00000DMB6", "B000021Y5U", "B0000A09EM", "B00019HNNC", "B00001ZT9E", "B00002STPE", "B00000IMNB", "B00001OWYW", "B00004U1R6", "B00000I1BG", "B00004T4YP", "B000FDOTIQ", "B000CBCVFE", "B00002SWCJ", "B0009SQFHA", "B00004U62A", "B000034DCF", "B00005BW7M", "B000006RGQ", "B00007LV7Y", "B00004R8XR", "B000006P0K", "B000029706", "B00002SUM5", "B00004ZCP0"], "bought_together": ["B00004XOM1", "B00000I1BY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000I1BY", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00000K1VA", "B00004XOM1"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 9782}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
