While the one-on-one combat here is essentially  two-dimensional, highly detailed 3-D character graphics and a roaming camera  viewpoint give this game a distinctive 3-D look. Gameplay is fast and furious,  with simple controls that are easy to learn. This game also allows for special  moves and combos to be executed with relative ease. Various modes of play are  available, including \"Tekken Force,\" a one-player side-scrolling brawler.Chock full of goodies--most of which remain hidden until certain requirements  are met--Tekken 3rewards players' persistent endeavors with secret  characters, alternate costumes, and yet another mode of play, Tekken ball,  a bizarre variation on volleyball. Also, beating the game's arcade mode allows  players to view a beautifully animated epilogue that's specific to whichever  fighter they used. And once you've seen one, you just have to see them all.--Joe HonPros:Near arcade-perfect conversionMultiple modes of play, including Tekken force minigameLots of hidden featuresBeautifully animated epilogues for each fighterCons:2-D background graphics", "price": 41.22, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51klT0WXK%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000006P0K", "B0000664JF", "B000006P0J", "B0002CHJ8C", "B00004U5VF", "B00000I1BZ", "B000021Y5P", "B00000DMAR", "B00001X50M", "B000034DMT", "B000034DC6", "B00000I1C1", "B00004TEXU", "B000K6TOK6", "B00004XOWT", "B000006RGS", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00000I1BR", "B001TEYMRI", "B000034DCF", "B000034DC7", "B000006RGQ", "B00000I1BQ", "B00001QED2", "B000034DMG", "B00000DMAU", "B0015MMN6G", "B00000DMB6", "B00000J9JI", "B00000I1C0", "B00000K1VA", "B00005MA97", "B00001QER9", "B000PWAAAI", "B00004TBGT", "B0053OMTVQ", "B00001QHW9", "B00001OWYW", "B00004R8XR", "B000038ABO", "B0015IXKSK", "B00000JGAR", "B00004LN2T", "B00000I1BG", "B00001ZWMV", "B000006RGR", "B00002STKS", "B00008H2IW", "B00000K1VE", "B000637T7S", "B00000I1BF", "B00000I1BY", "B00004U4R9", "B00004R9IG", "B0062DIGA0", "B00004ZCP0", "B000F1YHW6", "B00008G97F", "B0002B90OE", "B00000IODY", "B00004WLQ6", "B00000DMB4", "B0000296O5", "B00004TC6E", "B000935256", "B00000DMAV", "B000029706", "B00004U4R8", "B00000JNHJ", "B00000J96V", "B000038ABJ", "B0019LMXAY", "B00005ML10", "B00005Y402", "B00000JHPN", "B000GACEHQ", "B00000I1BV", "B00002R28F", "B00000JRSB", "B00004YRQ9", "B00000K1VK", "B00005NGLC", "B00004Y57G", "B000038AAP", "B00005Q8J1", "B000038ABK", "B000069BD9", "B000088KH9", "B00005NGR0", "B00005NN5Q", "B006KYYOSO", "B00000I1BS", "B00005J32C", "B00005OLX1", "B00003E4G9"], "bought_together": ["B000006P0K", "B0000664JF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000664JF", "B000006P0K", "B00004U5VF", "B0045L3SNQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 10342}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
