Professor Oak, the leading authority on Pok&eacute;mon, has given you your choice of three tame Pok&eacute;mon in exchange for your helping him catalog and document every Pok&eacute;mon in the world.But to catalog a Pok&eacute;mon, you have to capture it, by first beating it up with one of your trained Pok&eacute;mon, and then hitting it with an empty Pok&eacute; Ball. As your tame Pok&eacute;mon gain experience in battle, their abilities improve and they earn access to new attacks. Sometimes they even evolve into more advanced Pok&eacute;mon.Aside from capturing wild Pok&eacute;mon and evolving your own, you can catalog new Pok&eacute;mon--the only way to gather some Pok&eacute;mon--by trading with another Pok&eacute;mon player using either a link cable or the Game Boy Color's infrared system. Pok&eacute;mon gained through trades learn and evolve faster, and trading is the only way to capture all 151 Pok&eacute;mon, since each Pok&eacute;mon game (Pok&eacute;mon Red,Pok&eacute;mon Blue, andPok&eacute;mon Yellow) has certain Pok&eacute;mon missing.
