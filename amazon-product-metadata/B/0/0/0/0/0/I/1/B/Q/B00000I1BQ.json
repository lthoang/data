{"asin": "B00000I1BQ", "description": "In the tradition of great 3-D action jumping games,Crash Bandicootis probably the PlayStation equivalent of the groundbreaking Nintendo 64 titleSuper Mario 64. Now repackaged as one of PlayStation'sGreatest Hits, this top-selling game takes you away on a tropical island adventure that is filled with precarious enemies and challenging levels. Our spiky-haired hero Crash needs no weapons to survive the harsh jungle. Instead, he jumps, jogs, and spins his way through numerous lush and downright fun environments.With 26 levels spanned across three tropical islands,Crash Bandicootis sure to amuse old gamers as well as new. Crash must rescue his girlfriend, Tawna, from the evil clutches of Dr. Cortex. Along the way, he can gather fruit for extra lives, smash boxes for random prizes, and gather tokens that can be used for bonus rounds. Numerous big bosses block your path, which also includes more than a few risky jumps that require split-second timing.Crash Bandicoot's impressive graphics and strong gameplay have already won over many hard-core and casual gamers. While this PlayStation classic has already spawned two successful sequels, the original version remains a worthy purchase--particularly at the sub-$20 price.--Kasty ThomasPros:Sub-$20 priceHidden bonus levelsCons:None", "price": 59.94, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518PMA88SBL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1BR", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BF", "B000034DCF", "B000K6TOK6", "B000034DC2", "B0015MMN6G", "B00004U4R8", "B00004U4R9", "B00004XOWT", "B00005NCCI", "B00001QHW9", "B0045L3SNQ", "B000PWAAAI", "B000637T7S", "B000029706", "B00005MA97", "B00000I1BS", "B0015IXKSK", "B001TEYMRI", "B00000JNHJ", "B0062DIGA0", "B00004TBGT", "B000R3O1HS", "B00001QER9", "B00006F2ZP", "B0001CJEJU", "B00004SPYF", "B00000K1VK", "B000TLU67W", "9629971372", "B007UHQO6A", "B000GACEHQ", "B00004YRQ9", "B00001XDK5", "B001MW91IW", "B00005R5PO", "B00004YRQA", "B000021Y5T", "B0000C7GHG", "B000SMIUQQ", "B00001QED2", "B00005NGLC", "B00003E4GD", "B0007DFIK2", "B00000I1BU", "B0001CJCG0", "B00001ZWVR", "B0009F3E1I", "B00002STJI", "B0000690ZE", "B00EEFDNJ2", "B00004SWLT", "B000TYQL1O", "B00001ZWXH", "B00002STIW", "B00000DMAQ", "B000034DC7", "B000066TS5", "B000038ABJ", "B0007KTBB2", "B00002STEZ", "B000021Y5Q"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1BR", "B00000DMAR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000I1BR", "B00000DMAR", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005NCCI"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2438}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
