{"asin": "B00000I1BY", "description": "Zombies, an old mansion, and limited ammo. What more could you want?Resident Evil: Director's Cutplunges you into the world of B-grade zombie flicks, and does a first-class job of it. From the cheesy dialogue and voice acting to the confusing camera angles, you'll jump and squirm through a series of mind-numbing puzzles and heart-pounding attacks. The trick is: conserve your ammo, and learn to run.The game is interspersed with movie-style cut scenes that all too often annoy rather than elucidate. The gist of the story is this: you and your special forces teammates have come to investigate the disappearance of the last team, and you have no idea what you're getting into. You spend the rest of the game trying to find your way out of the mansion in which you're trapped. The bottom line: If you like zombie flicks, buy it, play it, love it. And the best part--try blowing the zombie dogs' heads off with the bazooka.--John CockingPros:Scary sound, camera angles, horror-movie actionSense of dread, dropping ammo countZombiesCons:Horrible dialogueBack-tracking for puzzlesThe bazooka won't blow open a door", "price": 125.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PCX6R23GL._SX300_.gif", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000034DMG", "B0019LMXAY", "B00000K1VA", "B00005ME6N", "B00001XDUB", "B00000I1BJ", "B00000K1VE", "B000B69E9G", "B00004WMVL", "B000006RGS", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00001X50M", "B0000TSRA6", "B000038ABO", "B000K6TOK6", "B0000657SP", "B0007L8GPI", "B0015MMN6G", "B00006LELI", "B000006RGR", "B00009KO3N", "B00005ME6O", "B00004XOWT", "B00004XOM1", "B000637T7S", "B00005MA97", "0761519181", "B000021Y5P", "B00000IODY", "B00000I1C1", "B00000I1C0", "B00001OWYW", "B0011BE3KA", "B00000DMB4", "B00004W4QJ", "B0000296O5", "B00001ZUGT", "B00000K10U", "B00007LV7Y", "B00004Y57G", "B00005LOXE", "B0001Y7404", "B00269DXR0", "B00000JRSB", "B00000I1BQ", "B00001ZWMV", "B00002R28C", "B00000K2X5", "0671024418", "B00007KQC5", "B001TEYMRI", "B00B59L9T6", "B00002STJN", "B00004TC6E", "B000QTD05C", "B0020H46D8", "B00000JHPN", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BR", "0671024396", "B00004YRQA", "B00000K2G7", "B00000I1BF", "B00007KQC4", "B000P297F2", "B004UDB9SA", "B000006P0K", "B002Z7BE24", "B00005ML10", "B0002A6CQ4", "067102440X", "B0002XL3BA", "B00002SVWG", "B00000DMAV", "B00004TBGT", "B00001YVBL", "B00004R9IG", "B000034DC6", "B00019AZB4", "B00001QHW9", "B00000I1BK", "B000TLU67W", "B0012N94WO", "B00001ZT9E", "B002PJCKUC", "B00008RUYZ", "B0002RQ3ES", "B000006OVJ", "B0050SXLQC", "B000CBCVFE", "B00005BISY", "B00005V9NH", "B000PWAAAI", "B00019HNNC", "B00269DXXO", "B00004T4YP", "B00004U4R8"], "bought_together": ["B00000K1VA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000034DMG", "B000B69E9G", "B00005ME6N", "B00000K1VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4137}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
