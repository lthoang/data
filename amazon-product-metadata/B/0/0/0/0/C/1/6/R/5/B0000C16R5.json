They can be carried in your camera bag all the time so tripod support is always at hand!Besides traditional tripod use, the Slik MINI series tripods have another great feature:  the ability to use the tripod as a &quot;Chest-Pod&quot; camera support!  To use as a chest-pod, first loosen the locking collar around the center column, pull out (raise) the center column at least one inch and tighten.  Then, with the legs spread, place the feet of the legs against your upper chest.  Loosen the tripod head and position the camera so you can see through the viewfinder comfortably.  This will better stabilize the camera and help avoid image-degrading &quot;camera shake.&quot;The bottom of the center column has a suction cup, which can be used to mount Slik MINI series tripods on a clean smooth glass surfaces, including windows. Stick a MINI series tripod to a window for a higher angle picture or take photos in low light with a slow shutter speed.All Slik MINI series tripods have 2-section telescoping legs to make the tripod more stable and get the camera up just a little higher.Please Note:The suction cup will not hold up cameras weighing more than 10 ounces!  Check your camera's specification to learn its weight.  Be sure the surface is clean before trying to adhere a Slik MINI series tripod to any glass surfaces!
