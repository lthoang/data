The high dome shape sends juices back into the pot, and the large knob made of high-density phenolic resin is easily grasped with a potholder. As with the pot it fits, the lid is safe for use in an oven up to 500 degrees F, and for cleaning in the dishwasher. Scanpan makes replacement glass covers for all its nonstick, cast-aluminum cookware.In response to environmental concerns regarding nonstick finishes, Scanpan in 2007 introduced its Green Tek nonstick technology. Working with its suppliers, Scanpan is the first cookware company to completely eliminate the use of the harmful chemical PFOA from the entire process used to make its nonstick compound. The new PFOA-free nonstick finish is now found on all Scanpan Classic and Professional cookware. Scanpan covers its cast-aluminum cookware with a full lifetime warranty.--Ann Bieri"}
