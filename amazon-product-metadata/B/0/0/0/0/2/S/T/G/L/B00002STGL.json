{"asin": "B00002STGL", "description": "A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players", "price": 49.9, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71fzEw4A6IL._SX300_.gif", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DMAT", "B00000INR2", "B00000DMB5", "B00002STEZ", "B000031KJT", "B00002STFD", "B00004UG9B", "B0015OG4G4", "B00000ID61", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00000DMB2", "B00002STI2", "B00002STH0", "B00000F1GM", "B00004S9AA", "B00000DMAX", "B00002STGN", "B00005M8TL", "B00000DMAQ", "B00002DHEV", "B00000K2G7", "B00000DMAO", "B000YOCGUO", "B000PJHAD6", "B00000ID60", "B00000J2W7", "B00004S9A7", "B00003OTI3", "B00000JQ0V", "B000021Y2Z", "B00002STFP", "B00000I1BE", "B00000DMB9", "B000QHOHHE", "B00000J2OO", "B00004U1QY", "B00004SWLT", "B00004U1R2", "B00000I1BB", "B00002STGQ", "B00001TZYB", "B00004WLMA", "B005GTND0E", "B002TK1PX0", "B00002STH5", "B000031KJM", "B00001QES1", "B00002STGE", "B00001OX4T", "B00000F1GS", "B00001TZYA", "B00002STHX", "B000F9JFXE", "B00000K1AF", "B00002STFH", "B005GTNC8W", "B00000JHPD", "B00001WRJO", "B00000K2GI", "B000046Q7Q", "B005DI7N7W", "B003UI5GLC", "B00000DMAZ", "B00000IFRI", "B00002SWF4", "B005GTNBGK", "B00005ME6D", "B00004U1R3", "B000021Y1B", "B00AAIDNTW", "B00004R9I4", "B000038A7C", "B000034DML", "B00000JQQM", "B00004TJE5", "B00856304Y", "B00002STFN", "B009MRZAUC", "B00001X5C3", "B000021Y0W", "B00004TUF1", "B000006OWT", "B000021Y30", "B00005C4IE", "B00004R9IB", "B00004U1R1", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000038A6U", "B000YA6S6Q"], "bought_together": ["B00000DMAT", "B00000DMAX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000DMAT", "B002TK1PX0", "B00002DHEV", "B000F9JFXE"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 3462}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
