{"asin": "B0000296O5", "description": "SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play", "price": 49.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sga5wQUuL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y57G", "B00000JRSB", "B00002R28C", "B00008RUYZ", "B00005LOXE", "156686903X", "B00002SVWG", "B00005TNI6", "B00004TC6E", "B00004S9AF", "B0015MMN6G", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00008URUA", "B000K6TOK6", "B000F5IH2I", "B000038ABO", "B000FDOTIQ", "B000038IFX", "B00005MA97", "B00001X50M", "B000637T7S", "0744000416", "B000034DMG", "B00004SPW9", "B00001XDUB", "B00004XOWT", "B00005BW7Q", "B00004W4QJ", "1566867142", "0744001404", "B000GABOTU", "B00000K1VE", "B0019LMXAY", "B00001OWYW", "0744002850", "B00001ZWMV", "B00000I1BY", "B00004XMRL", "B00000DMAR", "0744008379", "1566869196", "B00002SWCJ", "B000TLU67W", "B00002SVX5", "B000006OVE", "B0000C7GHG", "B00000JNHJ", "B0009A4EVM", "B00004YRQA", "B000006RGS", "B000066TS5", "B00000IM2T", "B0002CHJAA", "B00000K39I", "B00002STPE", "B00029QQNY", "B000SSQPU8", "B000LOAQNQ", "B000NPTOTK", "B0001OK7VW", "B001F6ATFO", "B00004S9AC", "B00000K2X5", "B000038AAN", "B000034DC7", "B00AO075UY", "B00000I1BQ", "B0014CN2H6", "B00BY0G0YU", "B000G82R20", "B00004SWM0", "B003O6JIVE", "B00000I1C0", "B003IFVF44", "B000SSPH3E", "B000FQ2DTA", "B000G77X34", "B001MW91IW", "B0015IXKSK", "B000G7X5MM", "B000034DBS", "B00000I1BG", "B00000I1BF", "B00024W1U6", "B0009A4EV2", "B00002STPG", "B001G3B0HC", "B000066TS3", "B001TD6SN0", "B00019HNNC", "B00004YRQ9", "9629971372", "B0002GTFIK", "B00004R8XR", "B00008KTRS", "B000NPOGWK", "074401543X", "B00008W2R8"], "bought_together": ["B00004Y57G", "B00000JRSB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y57G", "B00000JRSB", "B00005TNI6", "B0045L3SNQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1852}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
