{"asin": "B00002R28C", "description": "Showcasing two installments of SquareSoft's wildly popular role-playing  game (RPG) series,Final Fantasy Anthologyfeatures the U.S. debut ofFinal  Fantasy V, and reintroduces one of the best RPGs of all time,Final Fantasy  VI, originally released asFinal Fantasy IIIon the Super Nintendo gaming  system.Both games are straight Super Nintendo conversions, so their 2-D graphics and 16-bit  sounds are admittedly subpar by PlayStation standards. However, SquareSoft has added  brand-new, beautifully animated movies for both titles, and has givenFinal Fantasy  VIthe star treatment it deserves by adding a bonus mode where gamers can access  loads of supplementary material, such as artwork and data files on the game's monsters  and items.WhileFinal Fantasy Vis one of weaker entries in the series,Final Fantasy  VIalone is totally worth the price ofFinal Fantasy Anthology. Endearingly  melodramatic characters, a genuinely epic story line, and rock-solid gameplay makeFinal Fantasy VIjust as absorbing today as it was when it wasFinal Fantasy  III.--Joe HonPros:Brand-new animated moviesReissuesFinal Fantasy VI, one of the best RPGs everLots of supplementary material forFinal Fantasy VICons:Dated graphics and sounds may bother some gamersThe previously unreleasedFinal Fantasy Vmay as well have stayed  unreleased", "price": 16.25, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510UsQeMmyL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LOXE", "B00008RUYZ", "B00004Y57G", "B0000296O5", "B00004TC6E", "B00000JRSB", "B00002SVWG", "B000GABOTU", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00005TNI6", "B000F5IH2I", "B0015MMN6G", "B000NPTOTK", "B000038ABO", "B000NPOGWK", "B00008URUA", "1566869250", "B000FDOTIQ", "B004LLRYOY", "B000038IFX", "1566867142", "B00004S9AF", "B000K6TOK6", "B000034DMG", "B00000K39I", "B00005MA97", "B00001X50M", "0744000416", "B000SSPH3E", "B0009XBWY6", "B00001OWYW", "B00184219U", "B000637T7S", "B00004SPW9", "B00019HNNC", "B001C6GVI6", "B0014CN2H6", "B00024W1U6", "156686903X", "0744000734", "B00001XDUB", "B000TLU67W", "B002I0GXWO", "B0009A4EV2", "B00007KQC1", "B000F3AACA", "B00000I1BY", "B00004XMRL", "B000IONGU4", "074401543X", "B00004XOWT", "B00005BW7Q", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00008KTRS", "B003O6JIVE", "B00BY0G0YU", "B0009A4EVM", "0744002532", "B000034DBS", "B00004S9AC", "B000FQ2DTA", "B000E991PC", "B00000IM2T", "B0002B90OE", "B00004YRQA", "B0009Z3K9E", "B000006OVE", "B000G7X5P4", "B001TEYMRI", "B003KJ4C2U", "B000784XG2", "B000R3K4CE", "B00000K1VE", "B000G82R20", "B000006RGR", "B002I0GKIQ", "B000LOAQNQ", "B004BV5O0U", "B00KWFCU4M", "B000B69E9G", "B000066TS3", "B0002CHJAA", "B00004YRQ9", "B00005V9NH", "0744008379", "B001TD6SN0", "B002I0J4AM", "B00005T7ZP", "B0015IXKSK", "B0002Y2XXQ", "B00004W4QJ", "B00002STJI", "B00005MDZD", "B000G7X5MM", "B007R4X3AG", "B001YYQ9SS", "B00008VFBU", "B000AAPNKW"], "bought_together": ["B00005LOXE", "B00008RUYZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Y57G", "B00000JRSB", "B00004TC6E", "B0045L3SNQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 25}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
