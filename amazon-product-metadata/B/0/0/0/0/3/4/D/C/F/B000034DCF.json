{"asin": "B000034DCF", "description": "PlayStation owners no longer need to borrow their friend's Nintendo 64 in  order to have a rollicking good old time racing virtual turbo-charged go-karts through  outlandish environments.Crash Team Racingdoes an excellent job of re-creating  that same thrill on the PlayStation.Crash Team Racinghas all the marks of the kart-racing genre, including  big-headed characters driving diminutive go-karts, power-ups to increase speed and slow  down opponents, and thematic tracks with multiple paths for exploration. WhatCTRadds to the mix is fairness: tighter-turning cars are rewarded for precision  driving, skillful jumping, and strategic placement of booby traps. Sure, the playing field  is level, but the better the driver, the better chance he or she has of winning consistently  without any annoying \"catch-up code.\"The one-player game is wonderfully presented as an exploratory adventure, while the  multiplayer mode is a split-screen must-play for anyone with a PlayStation (and, of  course, friends). Twenty-five tracks, 12 characters, and responsive control makeCTRthe gotta-have racing game.--Jeff YoungPros:Excellent kart control, including power slides, hops, and wheeliesWide tracks encourage passingHigh replayability, especially in multiplayer modeCons:Characters aren't as cute as those inMario Kart", "price": 65.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512N8QahMOL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DMAR", "B00004U4R8", "B00000I1BR", "B00000I1BQ", "B00000I1BF", "B000034DC2", "B0015MMN6G", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00004U4R9", "B00004XOWT", "B000K6TOK6", "B00008NRM7", "B00005NCCI", "B0007KTBB2", "B0015IXKSK", "B00001QHW9", "B000PWAAAI", "B00000JNHJ", "B00004YB5V", "B00005MA97", "B00004YRQ9", "B000637T7S", "B00004TBGT", "B00000I1BS", "B00000K1VK", "B00001QER9", "B00001XDK5", "B000TGQLYE", "B0001CJEJU", "B000TLU67W", "B000029706", "B00006F2ZP", "B000R3O1HS", "B007UHQO6A", "B001MW91IW", "B0000C7GHG", "B000034DC7", "B00001ZWXH", "9629971372", "B00004YRQA", "B000066TS5", "B000093NQC", "B00002STO5", "B00005AQRE", "B000SEU92W", "B00005R5PO", "B000GACEHQ", "B0013JHKU0", "B00004SPYF", "B000SMIUQQ", "B001DIFV98", "B00001QED2", "B00EEFDNJ2", "B00067MX98", "B0000690ZE", "B00006FWUU", "B001TEYMRI", "B0015ACX3Q", "B00000IFKW", "B00004YZAO", "B00005Y402", "B000TYQL1O", "B004S3KB6S", "B000066BZ1", "B00002STJO", "B0013KW1B2"], "bought_together": ["B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045L3SNQ", "B00000DMAR", "B00004U4R8", "B00000I1BR"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2507}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
