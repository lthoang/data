{"asin": "B00003OTI3", "description": "As with just about anything brandishing the Pok&eacute;mon name,Pok&eacute;mon Stadiumis a must-have for any Pok&eacute;maniac. But this  title is especially geared towards owners ofPok&eacute;mon Red,Pok&eacute;mon Blue, orPok&eacute;mon Yellowfor the Game Boy.  Using the same battle system as the Game Boy games--think highly advanced  rock-paper-scissors--Pok&eacute;mon Stadiumallows players to enter  their Pok&eacute;mon in a variety of tournaments and other battle modes, all  featuring vibrant 3-D graphics and animation, as well as enhanced sounds and  announcer commentary. Using the included Transfer Pak, players can use their own  Pok&eacute;mon from Game Boy Game Paks, or they can choose from a pool of  rental Pok&eacute;mon.Pok&eacute;mon Stadiumisn't all battles, though. The Kids Club mode  features nine cutesy minigames that make for great multiplayer fun for all ages.  Gallery mode lets players take snapshots of Pok&eacute;mon (similar toPok&eacute;mon Snap), which can then be printed out as stickers at your  localPok&eacute;mon Snapstation.WhilePok&eacute;mon Stadiumdoesn't require that you already have any  Game Boy version ofPok&eacute;mon, players won't be able to access two  of the best features of the game without one. Pok&eacute;mon Lab allows players  to view, store, and better organize the data on their Game Paks, as well as  trade Pok&eacute;mon with another player (which requires an additional Transfer  Pak, sold separately).
