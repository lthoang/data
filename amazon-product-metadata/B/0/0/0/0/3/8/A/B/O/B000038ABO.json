{"asin": "B000038ABO", "description": "Parasite Evetells the story of Aya Brea of the NYPD on a case involving mass  spontaneous human combustion, mutating animals, and the mitochondria revolution. Sound fun?  Confusing?Parasite Eveis both.It begins when Aya is attending an opera at Carnegie Hall. The soloist bursts into song and the  audience bursts into flames. Somehow, Aya is the only attendee who isn't affected. Not  surprisingly, she wants to know what's going on. This curiosity, coupled with her duties as a police  officer, grows into a full-scale investigation.Parasite Eve's mechanics are simple, yet elegant. From combat to level advancement, the  game runs easily and smoothly, making it ideal for someone new to role-playing games (RPGs).  Experienced RPGers should still enjoy it for its brilliant storyline.Technically speaking, the game's graphics and sound are good, but not spectacular. The full-motion  cutscenes are superbly done.Parasite Eveis a good game--there's just not enough of it.  While it doesn't feel crammed together, the story seems to resolve quickly. Brilliant while it lasted,Parasite Eveleft me wanting more.--John CockingPros:Mutating dogsInvolving storylineElegant game mechanicsCons:Too short, and it's confusing", "price": 241.18, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aMS9AB5BL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W4QJ", "B00000K1VE", "B00004SPW9", "B00004TC6E", "B00001XDUB", "B0000296O5", "B000038IFX", "B00000JRSB", "B000034DMG", "B00004Y57G", "1566868246", "B00000I1BY", "B00004S9AF", "B00002SVWG", "B00002R28C", "B00008RUYZ", "B00001X50M", "B0019LMXAY", "B00000K39I", "B00001OWYW", "B00001ZUGT", "B00005LOXE", "B0045U4U52", "B00004U4R4", "B00005BW7Q", "B000637T7S", "B00002SVX5", "B00005MA97", "B00004S9AC", "B00001ZWMV", "B00004XMRL", "B0045L3SNQ", "B000K6TOK6", "B00002SWCJ", "B000006OVE", "B00004SWM0", "B000034DBS", "B00000K1VA", "B000FDOTIQ", "B00004XOM1", "B00000JHPN", "B0002CHJAA", "B00002STPG", "B000059Z7Q", "B00005ME6O", "0744000017", "B00000I1BK", "B00007LV7Y", "1932234209", "B00000I1BZ", "B000G82R20", "B001F6ATFO", "B0015MMN6G", "B00000IM2T", "B00000K2X5", "B00005ME6N", "B0009XBWY6", "B000038AAN", "B000B69E9G", "B0000A09EM", "B00002STJO", "B00005V9NH", "B00004XOWT", "B00008KTRS", "B00002STPE", "B00004RBQX", "B000006OVJ", "B00005TNI6", "B00002STPF", "B0001Y7404", "B00000I1BF", "B00000I1BG", "B000021Y5P", "B00002STKS", "B00000IODY", "B00002STJN", "B000006RGR", "B00004WMVL", "B00005T7ZN", "B0011BE3KA", "B00005Q8M4", "B001TEYMRI", "B00008URUA", "B00007KQC1", "B0002GTFIK", "B00KVRK39A", "B00004U5VK", "B00029QQNY", "B00005B70K", "B000TLU67W", "B000F3AACA", "B00000I1BQ", "B00000I1BR", "B0009UC6AI", "B000784XG2", "B00004S9AD", "B00004ZDFY", "B000G7X5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00004W4QJ", "B00004TC6E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TC6E", "B0045U4U52", "B00004S9AF", "B00004Y57G"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4587}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"]]}
