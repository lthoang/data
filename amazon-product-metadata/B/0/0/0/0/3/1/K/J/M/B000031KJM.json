{"asin": "B000031KJM", "description": "Although it's geared more for younger players,Pok&eacute;mon  Snapis good clean fun for Pok&eacute;mon fans of any age. In this  Pok&eacute;mon battle-free adventure, players assist Professor Oak in completing  his Pok&eacute;mon Report by photographing the cute little buggers in the wild  on Pok&eacute;mon Island. Players take a trolley-like ride through the island's  3-D environments, filled with Pok&eacute;mon that not only look just like they  do in the cartoons, but also have \"cries\" to match. While there's a limited  amount of film for each trip and no zoom lens, players enjoy great freedom of  directional movement from within the vehicle, thanks to solid controls.Pok&eacute;mon Snapisn't as easy as it looks, as not just any old picture  will satisfy Professor Oak; submissions for his Pok&eacute;mon Report are judged  on size, pose, technique, and whether or not there's more than one of the same  Pok&eacute;mon in the picture. As progress is made, new areas open up, and  players are given items to aid them in their quest. Although there are only  seven areas, they need to be revisited often, as hidden and otherwise  uncooperative Pok&eacute;mon must be \"coaxed\" by using items that you previously  didn't have before. Also, Pok&eacute;mon will do some of the craziest  things--which make for great photographs--but only under certain conditions that require  much experimentation (or a strategy guide) to unearth.--Joe HonPros:Good clean fun for Pok&eacute;mon fans of any ageCute Pok&eacute;mon 3-D graphics and \"cries\" faithful to the cartoon seriesPrint out stickers of your photos at a Pok&eacute;mon Snap Sticker StationCons:An anti-Pok&eacute;maniac's worst nightmareContains only 63 of the 151 Pok&eacute;monGame cartridge can hold only 1 player's save data", "price": 262.88, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGP0N3V9L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003OTI3", "B00002STH0", "B00002STEZ", "B000058BCU", "B00000F1GM", "B00002DHEV", "B00000DMAQ", "B00002STFH", "B00005M8TL", "B00000DMAX", "B00000ID61", "B00004R9IB", "B005GTNBGK", "B00000J2W7", "B000046S41", "B00000IFRI", "B005GTND0E", "B00004U1QX", "B000F9JFXE", "B000PJHAD6", "B002TK1PX0", "B000046Q7Q", "B00000INR2", "B00004SWLT", "B00004U1QY", "B00004S9AA", "B0015OG4G4", "B005GTNC8W", "B003UI5GLC", "B00004U1R0", "B00002STI2", "B00004U1R3", "B005DI7N7W", "B00005AW1W", "B00000J2OO", "B00000K1AF", "B00000ID60", "B00001QES1", "B000Y0CHX4", "B00003E4EB", "B00001OX4T", "B000038A6U", "B00000DMAO", "B00004U1R1", "B000YOCGUO", "B000QHOHHE", "B0009Y808Q", "B00004R9I4", "B002J44BXW", "B000JVM256", "B00005249D", "B00000DMB9", "B00000IYER", "B00004S9A7", "B00000I1BE", "B00002970G", "B00005ME6D", "B00002STF6", "B000031KJL", "B007SJMEHI", "B000050FAE", "B000021Y2Z", "B003ZU0PHU", "B000047GEI", "B00002STGT", "B00002STHX", "B00000JHPD", "B000YA6S6Q", "B00001ZWP8", "B00002SUZ5"], "bought_together": ["B00003OTI3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003OTI3", "B005GTNBGK", "B00002DHEV", "B00002STFH"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1976}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Nintendo 64", "Games"]]}
