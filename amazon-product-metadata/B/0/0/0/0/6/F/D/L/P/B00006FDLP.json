{"asin": "B00006FDLP", "description": "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings the MK series a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers classic gameplay.This installment introduces a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent's attacks, yet it also allows you to jump by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up to three different fighting styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless variations of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks allow for lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and are rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.) there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character's personal history, and gain Koins which can then be spent in the Krypt to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The additional content offered with this title is plentiful, including \"The Making ofDeadly Alliance\" and \"The History ofMortal Kombat\" featurettes.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by dishing up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising those features that made the MK series popular in the first place.--Carlos RodelaPros:Complex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresCons:Weak story lineUnbalanced combo system", "price": 30.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M89GWJZ5L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00019AZAK", "B000GPXSAS", "B0009R1T9U", "B001ELWMHI", "B001I020CW", "B00005NZ1G", "B000069BD9", "B0017ZDGWG", "B001CLG6SG", "B000G82DDS", "B000021Y5P", "B0016CQ0Q4", "B002K8Y23G", "B00008H2IU", "B0001KUE7S", "B000067DPM", "B0000C4M23", "B006ZTHGCK", "B000GPVUQ2", "B002I0J998", "B00008KTNW", "B00005NZ1I", "B00008J7NZ", "B00008G97E", "B0002IQC8Y", "B00005U8TR", "B0000A92KZ", "B0007ZD79E", "B0008JILX6", "B004MA1K1W", "B00007UHEQ", "B00CS9NJC2", "B0001ADAMO", "B0007SL202", "B00005R6YX", "B00129I75I", "B0002VS8U6", "B000F2JUOK", "B0009350C6", "B0002CTTQC", "B00005RCQ5", "B00006409Z", "B005UEW8C4", "B004MA1K12", "B0000AI1KE", "B000K6TOK6", "B0009VQANQ", "B00006JZQZ", "B00005RCQJ", "B000087L4G", "B0012N3ZXS", "B0002RQ3JS", "B000P7V4R6", "B00005RKO7", "B0006I5I58", "B00005O0I3", "B00005O0I9", "B0006DNMSS", "B000088KH3", "B000E61G4O", "B00019HNN2", "B007UM599I", "B0006ZJPRI", "B0000A1OG8", "B003IE9V28", "B0009Z3HXS", "B0002VYPEE", "B00009YEJR", "B000EMJA3C", "B000G6SPHI", "B000FDOTYU", "B0006JMLN4", "B0000664JF", "B0006I5I5I", "B0000AJMPK", "B000AX21VI", "B00005V5MZ", "B00006IJIS", "B000I7GI8I", "B00019AZBO", "B0006SST9U", "B0009R1SRS", "B00006F2ZQ", "B00009XS6B", "B0002B90BW", "B00019HNNC", "B000NDFFFE", "B0009O7HUS", "B000HVDEQO", "B00006409Y", "B0006BK5AI", "B00020BV0Q", "B0001UEHP8", "B0009UUQG4", "B00019AZA0", "B00005BZCH", "B0006ZJPSC", "B00006JC3S", "B0000A082T"], "bought_together": ["B00019AZAK", "B000GPXSAS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006ZTHGCK", "B00019AZAK", "B000GPXSAS", "B0017ZDGWG"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 16015}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "Xbox", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
