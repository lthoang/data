{"asin": "B00006FWTW", "description": "Oh no! It looks like your granddad was right--things really were better in the old days. At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk", "price": 69.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61cStkpOu%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UK88", "B00009WAUO", "B00005B8FZ", "B00005MDZY", "B00008URUF", "B0000A09EP", "B00005MI42", "B000070IW6", "B0001JXACA", "B00006LELB", "B000238EJ4", "B0009Z3MOW", "B00006M3R6", "B0001ZZNNI", "B00030GS80", "B000HE7KZC", "B0002TB4CW", "B000VBB69M", "B00012BSJ4", "B00002ST27", "B00005MDZZ", "B000087H7T", "B00005B8G1", "B00008DHNU", "B00027NWRY", "B00005BZE0", "B000GQ1G2E", "B00002ST28", "B00005OARM", "B000B5MV6A", "B00008KUA3", "B00000J9J9", "B0001ZZNME", "B0001615P2", "B0000A9Y11", "B000MIL3WY", "B0007D4MW2", "B00005MO5G", "B0002GTXJG", "B0007YXB8W", "B000B5MV60", "B00005B8G3", "B000BI3SIC", "B00009WAUM", "B00022GIYI", "B00005V9NJ", "B000QJ1NS8", "B000035XB0", "B00068O278", "B00007D02M", "B00009WAUK", "B002JEUDX4", "B000087PM3", "B00005ATSN", "B000090W86", "B000EGDEJY", "B00005NCCW", "B00005B8IX", "B0002Y67QA", "B002CJ8Z04", "B00002SVET", "B00004S99X", "B00002SVEO", "B00006LEMM", "B0009OO6XY", "B000AX224Y", "B000B8J7K0", "B000084314", "B00005NCCA", "B00005ATSM", "B000GLHQJG", "B00002SVER", "B00002ST3U", "B0002Y67PQ", "B000C1VJT8", "B008216WOW", "B00005LOW5", "B000FDKZMU", "B000M4IOE8", "B00000IWYT", "B0002Y67Q0", "B00002SVES", "B000A32ODI", "B0006GBCZU", "B00008YMZV", "B000FW57CE", "B000LY4IDK", "B00008KTLZ", "B00009ZOHG", "B0006SSR24", "B0006B0O9U"], "bought_together": ["B00005UK88", "B00009WAUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005UK88", "B00009WAUO", "B00005MDZY", "B00005B8FZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 7675}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Games"]]}
