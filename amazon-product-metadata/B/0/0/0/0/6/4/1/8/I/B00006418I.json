{"asin": "B00006418I", "description": "Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.", "price": 36.8, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rJES0S8AL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005BOSF", "B0000E5U6N", "B000L9NPGG", "B00BS520SG", "B00012D0SG", "B000066JRN", "B00009WAUD", "B000084318", "9861019731", "B00005QEFD", "B004CHLNWQ", "B000S6AG9G", "B0017KIBAI", "B0001VNNE8", "B00095KU5G", "B002TLTBN0", "B00006IJJI", "B008OGWH3A", "B0009VXBAQ", "B002BSC54I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0017KIBAI", "B00005BOSF", "B0000E5U6N", "B001AI7CF2"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 14642}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube", "Hardware", "Accessories"], ["Video Games", "Wii", "Accessories", "Controllers"]]}
