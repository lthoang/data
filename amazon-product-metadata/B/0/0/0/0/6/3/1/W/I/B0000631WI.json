{"asin": "B0000631WI", "description": "InStuntman, you'll perform dangerous stunts in three or four vehicles as you play the part of a Hollywood stuntman for hire. You'll need to be good: the stunts will get harder, and you must accumulate skills to progress from low-budget productions to multimillion-dollar Hollywood blockbusters. Each stunt consists of a series of clearly defined objectives, which can range from 180-degree spins to perfectly timed jumps, dramatic barrel rolls, and T-bone smashes. To succeed, the player must achieve all or some of each scene's set objectives. Stunts take place on movie sets in six different countries around the world; completing each stunt rewards you with bonus items for use in the Stunt Arena, which you create yourself.Stuntmanwas developed with the help of one of the movies' most experienced stuntmen, Vic Armstrong.", "price": 9.85, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TTA7QT3TL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCXK4W", "B0000503MO", "B0002IQC8E", "B000OCXK6K", "B00006N5SZ", "B0002XL3BA", "B00006Z7I3", "B0001VGFK2", "B00005V6B9", "B000KCX9M4", "B00097CYZS", "B00006JN5H", "B000EHQDA0", "B00004YRQA", "B000088KH1", "B00GZ1GUSY", "B0000C7GHG", "B001MW91IW", "B00005NCA7", "B00009WAVD", "B000G6SPHI", "B0000TSR4C", "B0001XASIK", "B00020BV2E", "B00005V6BB", "B0000690ZE", "B0045L3SNQ", "B0000A03AG", "B0009O7HVM", "B000TLU67W", "B00006GSNX", "B00004WKN9", "B000093NQM", "B0001ADALA", "B0002HLKIC", "B00008URUA", "B000CSUKZ0", "B0009R1T72", "B00004UFRD", "B0000696CZ", "B0000A0MDV", "B00005J536", "B00012TIVY", "B000OCXK5Q", "B0002IBEFA", "B005C7R8I8", "B0000A03AE", "9629971372", "B004QEV0MI", "B0009OO6ZC", "B0013OM528", "B00009XS6I", "B000A87T42", "B00006JC3W", "B0000A1HW6", "B00005NODF", "B00005NFN4", "B000056PGW", "B000BBODX8", "B000067DPX", "B00006JC3Y", "B000HKKN7S", "B00070EBIK", "B000E9T7K6", "B0000A03C5"], "bought_together": ["B000OCXK4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OCXK6K", "B0000696CZ", "B00006IJJE", "B000OCXK5Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 16961}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2"]]}
