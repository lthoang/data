{"asin": "B000069BD9", "description": "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system", "price": 26.5, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CWYDEHsKL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00019AZBO", "B001CLG6SG", "B000GPVUQ2", "B0009R1T9K", "B000021Y5P", "B0002CHJ8C", "B0000664JF", "B0002B90OE", "B000021Y5U", "B0002XL3BA", "B0002EJ8FC", "B000G6SPHI", "B000935256", "B0002TG3Z0", "B000021Y2F", "B000F3AACA", "B000B69E9G", "B00004U5VF", "B000TLU67W", "B00004YRQ9", "B0001VGFK2", "B0000A30R8", "B0000696CZ", "B00005J536", "B00005NCCR", "B00008H2IW", "B00005ME6N", "B00026RFI2", "B0009HAYDC", "B001MW91IW", "B00005ML10", "B0009351R0", "B0000A8VBZ", "B000EHQDA0", "B00005BR6H", "B0013JHKU0", "B00006FDLP", "B000G79YNQ", "B00005J32C", "B0002IQCSY", "B00005O0I2", "9629971372", "B000LWHNCK", "B000069D39", "B0002RQ3ES", "B00005V6BP", "B000095ZH6", "B0000A0MDV", "B0000C4M22", "B00004YRQA", "B000F0GX8I", "B00020V5B6", "B00005U8TQ", "B00008DHNL", "B000EMJA3M", "B00005V6BE", "B00000IZS1", "B0009UUQGE", "B00019AZAK", "B00005Q8J1", "B000TYQL1O", "B00005Y1BG", "B00000K2R4", "B0001Q5SG4", "B0007PLKZM", "B00005NUIZ", "B00009ZVHY", "B0000TSRA6", "B0009I6S0O", "B000G7YX14", "B0033T1UWW", "B0007ULFL6", "B00000K2X5", "B000V7889C", "B0009Z3HYW", "B00006JN5H", "B00004U5VI", "B00005BK7X", "B0013KW1B2", "B0000503MO", "B00067MX98", "B00008NRM7", "B0002CHJ3M", "B0009XBWY6", "B006ZTHFPS", "B0009O7HVM", "B000P7V4R6", "B00005OLX1", "0744001730", "B00005NCCI", "B000FW87AI", "B0017HM0JY", "B0009WPZPY", "B000FUUD8O", "B0002RQ3I4", "B0000AHRPM", "B000099T2H"], "bought_together": ["B001CLG6SG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CLG6SG", "B00019AZBO", "B000GPVUQ2", "B00004YRQA"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4958}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
