{"asin": "B00006599U", "description": "Fox McCloud is back, but he&#x92;s left the on-the-rails, shoot-'em-up larks of his previous two games behind--this all-new Star Fox adventure sees the super furry animal in a veryZeldaesque bid to save Dinosaur Planet.Although the control system is very similar toThe Legend of Zelda's,Star Fox Adventuresis no simple clone. It&#x92;s your job as the mercenary mammal to find all the spellstones that will rejoin the splintered planet and defeat the evil General Scales. This entails much exploring of ancient temples and completing of subquests to help everything from Yorkshire-accented woolly mammoths to pterodactyls who've lost their babies.The game may lack the epic scale and endless invention ofZeldabut it has plenty of new ideas of its own, including a fully interactive dinosaur sidekick, some cool shoot-'em-up sections in Fox&#x92;s spaceship, and lots of ways to upgrade a magical staff--your weapon of choice when out of your ship. To add some icing to the cake, the graphics are absolutely amazing, particularly the superrealistic fur effects.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk", "price": 89.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512EC3HYF1L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002ILS24", "B00006IJJK", "B00009PS24", "B000066JRN", "B000084318", "B0002ILS1U", "B0002ILS1K", "B00005Q8LR", "B00005QDPZ", "B000FW64OY", "B00012D0SG", "B00009WAUH", "B00009WAUD", "9861019731", "B000070IWB", "B00005QEFD", "B000L9NPGG", "B004CHLNWQ", "B000ARPXU0", "B00006FWTX", "B00009KO3S", "B00006IJJI", "B00008H2IS", "B00005Q8M0", "B0009UBR3A", "B00009PS22", "B00006LEMY", "B00005Q8LY", "B002L8W5V6", "B0000A1OG4", "1930206224", "B000A15K0Y", "B000641ZC2", "B0002A6CQ4", "B00009WAUB", "B000B8J7JQ", "B00006LU9B", "B00095KU5G", "B00009WAUF", "B00005Q8LV", "B00005ULXN", "B0009PM8V0", "B00008KTWH", "B0009XEC0M", "B0000A2Y96", "B00005QDQ1", "B00005Q8M4", "B0000657SP", "B000067K2D", "B00006966U", "B00005QEFF", "B000ARJI88", "B0001JXAC0", "B0009Z3I0K", "B0009Z3MGA", "B0000A09EN", "B0002CHIWO", "B00005U8TI", "B00008URUB", "B002L93F0A", "B0000657SM", "B0000A0O28", "B000646MLQ", "B0001YYNL2", "B000069BB0", "B0017KIBAI", "B00005Q8LG", "B000095ZHA", "B0002IQOPU", "B00006DY1M", "B00006LEMP", "B0000A09EI", "B00019AZC8", "B00KWF38AW", "B000AQA9UA", "B00006HBTW", "B00006LU9D", "B0000AHOON", "B0009XSMNA", "B00006599P", "B000066JRH", "B00006LELI", "B0000E5U6K", "B0000A03CX", "B000620PSY", "B000FDOU9E", "B00007KUUD", "B0001JSSLS", "B0000C6EDJ", "B00006FDLO", "B000UY2TJG", "B0009XEC0C", "B009CCTSIM", "B0001OK7VW", "B000EHPQMG", "B00006JN5O", "B00006AVB1"], "bought_together": ["B0002ILS24", "B000ARPXU0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006YXLE", "B0002ILS24", "B00006IJJK", "B00005QDPZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2489}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
