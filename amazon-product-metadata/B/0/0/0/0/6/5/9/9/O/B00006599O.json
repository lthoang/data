{"asin": "B00006599O", "description": "Turok: Evolutionis a prequel that takes us back to the origins of the Turok lineage. In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.", "price": 51.46, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DT13XNRVL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E6XXWU", "B0009351R0", "B000B69E9G", "B000O5FUKQ", "B0000696CZ", "B0007ULFL6", "B001CLG6SG", "B00020LZAW", "B0013KW1B2", "B0032GTMEE", "B000A0EFHY", "B00097CYZS", "B000RW3V7U", "B0000664JF", "B0000C7GHG", "B000G6SPHI", "B001MW91IW", "B0015ACX3Q", "9629971372", "B00095LEC4", "B0009R1T9K", "B000EMJA3M", "B000EHQDA0", "B00005V6BB", "B0000B0MNH", "B0002CHJ8C", "B00005BIG7", "B00005O0I2", "B00005J536", "B00006LELA", "B00009WAVD", "B0009O7HVM", "B0013JHKU0", "B000GPVUQ2", "B0001ADAME", "B00020LZBG", "B00004YRQ9", "B00005BR6H", "B0002XL3BA", "B00008DHNL", "B000NJH6RS", "B000JLIXIG", "B000GPXS9Y", "B00005U8TQ", "B000087L4E", "B000069BD9", "B0000A09EM", "B00024W1TC", "B00019AZBO", "B0000A30R8", "B00006JN5H", "B0001CJEJU", "B0009Z3HXI", "B00BNAE14W", "B00019AZB4", "B00007UHJY", "B00020LZAM", "B000069D39", "B0001AVSGY", "B000067DPL", "B000066RKC", "B0009I6S0Y", "B00009ZVHY", "B001TOMQSK", "B000TLU67W", "B00004U5VK", "B0012LHO46", "B000099T2H", "B00006GSNZ", "B00005NN5J", "B0000A1HW3", "B000095ZH5", "B000XPJ026", "B0009Z3HYW", "B0009EHQVI", "B003S2MXQG", "B0002IQCSY", "B00B59L9T6", "B00008H2IW", "B00006Z7HU", "B00011V8EA", "B00004TJE5", "B00006599Q", "B0000C4M22", "B00004YRQA", "B00005R5PO", "B000099T2E", "B00127S3A4", "B00006N5SZ", "B0002RQ3I4", "B0002B90OE", "B000067K2C", "B0007OSLAA", "B000FUUD8O", "B002BWS5QG", "B0088MVP2Y", "B0009HAYDC", "B00006RHM0", "B000086JYK"], "bought_together": ["B002E6XXWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007ULFL6", "B000O5DS32", "B000B69E9G", "B000A0EFHY"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 13480}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
