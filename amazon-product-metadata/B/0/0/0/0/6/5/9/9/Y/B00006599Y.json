{"asin": "B00006599Y", "description": "From Wikipedia:\nSoldier of Fortune II: Double Helix is a video game created by Raven Software, a sequel to Soldier of Fortune. It was developed using the Quake III: Team Arena engine. Once again, Raven hired John Mullins to act as a consultant on the game. Based on comments and criticisms of the original game, Raven Software developed Soldier of Fortune II to be a more \"realistic\" game, with tactical shooters like Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six as inspirations rather than Quake. A sequel titled Soldier of Fortune: Payback, made by Cauldron HQ was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2007.", "price": 40.5, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EMCZT86JL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TTGSIA", "B00005OBQC", "B00003031F", "B0000663TT", "B002I0JAJ2", "B0000A4F0R", "B00006IINZ", "B000028U28", "B000067O0Q", "B00004W419", "B0000D12XI", "B000BC38RO", "B0001BYH16", "B00004WHWF", "B00005QX48", "B00009MQHU", "B00004YC3U", "B0000488VT"], "bought_together": ["B00005OBQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TTGSIA", "B00006IINZ", "B00008S7XI", "B00005OBQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 31136}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PC", "Games"]]}
