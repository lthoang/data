{"asin": "B000067FDY", "description": "Star Wars Galaxiesis a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that lets you assume the role of nearly any type of character in theStar Warsuniverse and interact with thousands of other players' characters as well as established characters from the movies. You can be a shady smuggler, like Han. You can be a cold bounty hunter, like Boba Fett. You can even be a Jedi, like Luke. You can create and develop any character you like and seek out adventure and excitement as you see fit. Best of all, the game never ends--it persists and changes online, even when you're not playing. Interaction with other players is what this game is all about; you can get together with your Rebel friends and raid an Imperial bunker, or work with other Imperial troops to squash Rebel scum. You can instruct young Jedi in the ways of the Force, or you can work with other bounty hunters to hunt down outlaw Jedi and bring them to justice. Or you can manage a cantina or parts shop and marvel at the galaxy's vast variety of heroes, scum, and villainy.", "price": 49.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R6YF4DZVL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00024DW2W", "B000BKF2I4", "B0008EZDDM", "B0067G55XS", "0761542191", "B000GG1OXA", "B000SOYG8U", "1612182615", "B000092P4A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BKF2I4", "B0008EZDDM", "B000092P4A", "B000GG1OXA"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 21551}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PC", "Games"]]}
