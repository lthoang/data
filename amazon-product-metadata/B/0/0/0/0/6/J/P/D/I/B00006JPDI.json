The 2-way speakers would suitably fill out your home theater with surround sound, enliven your dorm or apartment with music, or provide gentle background ambience in your bedroom or business.Use one pair for stereo or surround applications or pick up 2 pairs (4 speakers) for use as the front and surround elements in a multichannel listening system. The speakers are magnetically shielded for distortion-free placement near your television or computer monitor. Video programs sound more lifelike and enveloping with timbrally matched speakers all around, and plenty of newer music formats--from the DTS surround CD to DVD-Audio and SACD--offer music from your favorite artists mixed expressly for surround-sound listening. (Alternately, you could use these as surround speakers with larger, floorstanding speakers for the front left/right channels.)Standing just under 15 inches tall, the DV62si speakers each use a custom-designed .75-inch, ferrofluid-cooled dome tweeter for extended high frequencies and a 6-inch poly/graphite-blend woofer is light yet rigid for tight, accurate, and remarkably extended bass.What's in the BoxTwo speakers with grilles, a user's manual, and warranty information."}
