Designed to get towels deliciously toasty, the rack also helps keep them dry and fresh, reducing the need for laundering and the overall presence of mildew. Its dry electric Filatherm element runs without the use of oil or liquid and uses less energy than a typical light bulb. Styled like a ladder with a subtle curve to the rungs, the rack features a handsome chrome finish. Warmrails recommends running it 24 hours a day but includes a discreet on/off switch for when it is not needed. Both UL- and CUL-listed, the rack plugs in with a standard three-prong power cord and can easily be transported from the bathroom to the laundry room or nursery. Measuring 24-1/8 by 13-3/4 by 39 inches, it requires minimal assembly and carries a one-year warranty.--Emily Bedard"}
