{"asin": "B00007UHPJ", "description": "Primalfollows the story of Jen Tate, a modern woman who must face the demons of an immortal universe to discover her own supernatural origin. As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds. Additional technological achievements include seamless character morphing between Jen&#146;s human and demon forms, extravagant particle effects, and environmental effects such as fog and mist.", "price": 12.94, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318PZ423PML.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000066JRQ", "B0001I9YG2", "B00005Q8IR", "B00006AN1F", "B0002XL3BA", "B00005NCCR", "B00009ZVHY", "B00004YRQA", "B0002GTFIK", "B000N0WBL8", "B00009KO3L", "B0009351R0", "B0009RG8DW", "B00005R5PO", "B00004YRQ9", "B0009SQF0C", "B00005OLX1", "B00008URUA", "B000TLU67W", "B001CLG6SG", "B000066TS3", "B00009ZVHW", "B00005J536", "B00005V9NH", "B00005ML0X", "B00005B70K", "B00004U5VK", "B00005ME6N", "B00009IFE6", "B00005BW7M", "B0000A09EM", "B00004TN1Z", "B000B69E9G", "B00005UNWC", "B000G6SPHI", "B000066TS5", "B00005TNI6", "B00009YEK1", "B00009WAVI", "B00007E1OA", "9629971372", "B0000E331A", "B0000690Z9", "B00004TNDE", "B000E49SGE", "B000F5IH2I", "B00002STPE", "B00020LZAM", "B0009Z3HXI", "B00020LZAW", "B0002CTTR6", "B000099T1Y", "B000LOAQNQ", "B00008DHNL", "B0000524NF", "B00001ZWMV", "B000A0EFJM", "B0009A4EV2", "B0002CHJ00", "B0002B90OO", "B0000A92KX", "B000099T2K", "B00005V6B9", "B00006GSNX", "B0009XBWY6", "B000G77X34", "B00019HNNM", "B00019HNNC", "B0045L3SNQ", "B00006LEM8", "B0001A86EG", "B000056C34", "B001C48H8K", "B000038ABO", "B00004YUWA", "B0001NBNGG", "B0009VRSJ6", "B0009UUQGE", "B00004WYR7", "B0002IQI0Q", "B00005NGR0", "B0001VGFK2", "B0009EHQVI", "B0002CHJ64", "B000099T2E", "B00005BW7Q", "B00001ZUGT", "B000IONGU4", "B00004ZDFY", "B0009VQANG", "B00006GSO0", "B00004WKN9", "B0002WYUAW", "B0002Y2XXQ", "B0009R1TGS", "B0000690ZE", "B0009UC6AI", "B0013KW1B2", "B0000A8VBZ"], "bought_together": ["B000066JRQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005TNI6", "B00004YRQA", "B000B69E9G", "B0009RG8DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 7853}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
