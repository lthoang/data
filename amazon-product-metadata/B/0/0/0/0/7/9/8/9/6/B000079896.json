That&rsquo;s why using an Indus-Tool FW cozy foot warmer can help reduce your indoor heating costs. At only 90 watts, one of these units tucked under a desk allows you to turn the building thermostat down, thereby saving you money. The warmer is less costly to use than a space heater, and safer, too, as there are no exposed heating coils or carbon monoxide emissions. It is ETL listed and has a lifetime warranty.--Josh DettweilerWhat&rsquo;s in the BoxFoot-warmer pad, power cord"}
