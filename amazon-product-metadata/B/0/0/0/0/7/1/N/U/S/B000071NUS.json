But there are lots of reasons to avoid chemical deterrents, traps, and hazardous electric fences.Whether you're a dedicated organic vegetable gardener or a parent looking out for the health of children and pets that play in your yard, you'll appreciate the simple, innovative, and effective water-based concept behind the Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler. It's also a great choice for neighborhoods where fences are prohibited and for people who consider wire fences and other visual barriers unappealing.When the ScareCrow detects an animal it instantly releases a short but startling burst of water. The sudden spray of water and the movement and noise of the sprinkler scares animals away. Animals associate this negative experience with the area and avoid your yard in the future.Versatile and Broad-Reaching for Maximum EffectivenessThe Scarecrow is versatile enough to keep deer, rabbits, and other foragers from snacking on plants and bulbs, to prevent dogs from digging up newly seeded lawns, to keep the cat from using your garden as a litter box, and to scare predators like herons and raccoons away from your fish pond.The ScareCrow's motion detector is powerful enough to guard an area up to 1000 square feet of coverage with a single sprinkler. For added coverage, Scarecrow sprinklers can be linked in series to guard larger spaces.Efficient Design and Easy to Set UpSetting the Scarecrow up is fast and easy, and doesn't require any special tools. Simply install a standard 9-volt battery, connect the sprinkler to your hose, push the 17-inch stake into ground to secure the unit, and set the adjustable sprinkler arc to cover the area you want protected.What's in the BoxScarecrow Motion-Activated SprinklerKeep cats from using your garden as a litter box or prevent raccoons and herons from snacking in your fish pond."}
