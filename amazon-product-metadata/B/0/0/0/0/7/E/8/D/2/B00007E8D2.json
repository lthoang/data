{"asin": "B00007E8D2", "description": "With a comfortable working height of 58.3 inches and a minimum operating height of 20.3 inches, the Sunpak 6601UT tripod offers plenty of versatility when setting up for still or video camera shots. The 6601UT is distinguished by such features as a quick-release platform with an integral bubble level for precise leveling, a second circular bubble level at the critical tripod collar for precise alignment, and a precision- geared center column with a 1/4 x 20 accessory mounting stud. It's also a breeze to make individual adjustments thanks to the three-way pan head--complete with reference scales--and the large locking platforms. Other details include metal center leg braces, a tension/load adjustment system, quick-release leg locks with heavy-duty rubber leg tips, and retractable spiked feet for rock-solid stability in uneven terrain. The tripod, which comes with a second quick-release mounting plate for a second camera or camcorder, is coated in a distinctive champagne finish.", "title": "Sunpak 620-060 Tripod", "price": 19.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NBqRkHizL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HGC04G", "B0010CKE7G", "B00009UT3F", "B0002E1TWC", "B00009UT28", "B00009UT1Z", "B005UG3KS8", "B00CF5OHZ2", "B003VNKNF0", "B0080JH3YE", "B006UMMP2I", "B00004ZCJG", "B00009UTZA", "B00BXA7N6A", "B0039BPG1K", "B002HJ9PTO", "B001TSSOQY", "B003VTZE4Y", "B0073GJFAA", "B00AR95H7U", "B00BCEJ0E0", "B003547GRI", "B0040IWVBY", "B007M54E1M", "B0051G9ZTK", "B006JH8T3S", "B003L1ZYZ6", "B0037NX6JY", "B007M54E08", "B005AKF3ES", "B001TZWNF0", "B002ZIMEMW", "B004VTAVLE", "B005UFZ7F8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009UT3F", "B000V7AF8E", "B00009UT28", "B004ZGLM5W"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Tripods & Monopods", "Complete Tripods"]]}
