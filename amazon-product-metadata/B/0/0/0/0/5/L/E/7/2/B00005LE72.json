They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the \"glass\" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 35mm f2D AF Nikkor is a compact, lightweight wide-angle lens constructed with superb optical design for architecture, wedding, and landscape photography. It features 62-degree (44-degree with Nikon DX format) picture coverage with edge-to-edge sharpness. The perfect lens for the photographer on the go, the fast f2 maximum aperture makes this ideal for low light, hand-held shooting. It also weighs an exceptionally light 7.2 ounces and boasts a 0.85-foot close focusing distance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras.What's in the Box:Lens, 52mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1.", "title": "Nikon 35mm f/2D AF Wide-Angle Nikkor Lens for Nikon 35mm and Digital SLR Cameras", "price": 352.19, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VPCiLiq5L._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "Nikon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0031CS83U", "B00005LE6Z", "B0000BZL47", "B00004ZCJG", "B00005LENO", "B0045KGZOG", "B0099XGZXA", "B00FOTF8M2", "B00LAJQVR6", "B0076AYNXM", "B00005LEOC", "B003G8CPCE", "B00LBJGULC", "B006TAP096", "B00005LE75", "B00009R96C", "B0042X9L6A", "B000A6EXNO", "1781451001", "B000EOSHGQ", "B001GCVA0U", "B0050YG3CU", "B0045TYDNC", "B00IAYFDIC", "B00FXYTLIK", "B00006I5J4", "B00005LEOH", "B00005LE76", "B00005LEN4", "B000BYCKUI", "B007NDL56A", "B00005LE71", "B004Y1AYAC", "B00GD1K8J8", "B000VDCT3C", "B0016XIQ1U", "B0076UXKDG", "B009AB3SX6", "B00007EDZG", "B004482OOY", "B00GUQJZCW", "B004YTCNJY", "B00GD1KASM", "B00IF4O9Q4", "B003ZSHNEA", "B000KKPN5C", "1937538451", "B00B1WRGGM", "B009ISLNGU", "B0000BZL3G", "B00005LE77", "B001F6TXME", "B003ZSHNE0", "B0000BZM1F", "B007W5B59G", "B0095ZKUD8", "B002SXNXUG", "B00005LEOK", "B00006JN3G", "B007VGGIRK", "B004FNRTGG", "B001BTCSI6", "B006NYJNTG", "B00FSB79KU", "B00006I5JA", "B007M54E1M", "B00021EE4U", "B007TIYZ3Y", "B00004ZCJM", "B00009R98A", "B000VDCTCI", "B00004ZCAU", "B009VZOK0Q", "B000HJPK2C", "B00006I5J7", "B005PCDSBQ", "B0018ZDGAW", "B002P370AI", "B00BXA7N6A", "B00HYAL88W", "B0099Y21ZA", "B00D8HYDPU", "B000BWRIE8", "B0009M1BRU", "B006UOYXMQ", "B008FJJ66C", "B00AN8U0Y0", "B004OVE174", "B000BGZMSI", "B000BYCKU8", "B00DORFOBG", "B0056MPWZU", "B000PH1DL8", "B0000BZLBQ", "B0029WUKVG", "B004YW79F4", "B003UOIMAS", "B0002ER2NW", "B002NO7PWC"], "bought_together": ["B00004ZCJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S2PPT0", "B00004ZCJG", "B00005LEN4", "B004Y1AYAC"]}}
