{"asin": "B00005LBHM", "description": "Pok&eacute;mon Crystalis toPok&eacute;mon GoldandSilverwhatPok&eacute;mon Yellowis toPok&eacute;mon RedandBlue. It features several  minor upgrades from its predecessors, but in essence it's still the same game.  The classic Pok&eacute;mon formula of adventuring, collecting, and battling is  at a series best withCrystal. This is one of the best and most addictive  role-playing games for the Game Boy Color.The most notable feature is the  selectable female trainer who has her own set of animations and backgrounds.  This is a great option for female Pok&eacute;mon fans who were previously stuck  playing the game as a male character. There are also subtle improvements to the  cell phone system, HM moves, and prebattle animations. Rival trainers' phone  calls are now more plentiful and pragmatic. HM moves, which are required  throughout the game, are available at the push of a button--you'll no longer  have to navigate menus to use these moves. Lastly, seeing a Pok&eacute;mon's new  animation makes encountering new creatures more fun than before.If you  haven't playedGoldorSilveryet,Crystalis definitely  the way to go. If you've played those previous games,Crystalhas only  enough new features to justify a purchase from Pok&eacute;mon fanatics. This  game is compatible with the link cable, Game Boy printer, and Pok&eacute;mon  Pikachu 2. It's playable on Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only, and can be  played on a television usingPok&eacute;mon Stadium 2and a Transfer Pak.--Raymond M.
