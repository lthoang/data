{"asin": "B00005UK88", "description": "Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2boasts all 96 levels from the original Super NES game, from cheery Yoshi's Island through the sprawling Vanilla Dome to the grueling Star Road. While some levels emphasize pure action, others require you to puzzle your way out of the mazes and illusions. If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.", "price": 75.58, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61xrQNMh7DL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009WAUO", "B00005B8FZ", "B00006FWTW", "B00008URUF", "B00005MDZY", "B00006LELB", "B0001ZZNNI", "B000070IW6", "B0002TB4CW", "B00005B8G1", "B0000A09EP", "B000238EJ4", "B0009Z3MOW", "B00005B8G3", "B00005BZE0", "B00000J9J9", "B00002ST28", "B00002ST27", "B000VBB69M", "B00030GS80", "B000087PM3", "B000B5MV6A", "B0001ZZNME", "B000B5MV60", "B00005V9NJ", "B000087H7T", "B00002SVEO", "B00006M3R6", "B000GQ1G2E", "B00005MI42", "B000MIL3WY", "B000EGDEJY", "B00005NECC", "B00005MO5G", "B00012BSJ4", "B0000A9Y11", "B0001615P2", "B0001JXACA", "B0015DOOEY", "B00027NWRY", "B00005NCCW", "B0001ZZNLK", "B0002Y67QA", "B00005MDZZ", "B0019R361I", "B00005B8G2", "B000065SQ9", "B000QJ1NS8", "B002CJ8Z04", "B00008DHNU", "B000BI3SIC", "B000084314", "B000ERVM06", "B0007D4MW2", "B00005OARM", "B000ERVMI8", "B000A32ODI", "B00006IJJJ", "B0006GBCZU", "B000M4IOE8", "B00008KUA3", "B0006SSR24", "B0006B0O9U", "B000090W86", "B000AX224Y", "B0002Y67Q0", "B000FW57CE", "B00004S9A0", "B00002SVER", "B00007D02M", "B00068O278", "B000HE7KZC", "B000I10PY2", "B00004TCT3", "B00009WAUK", "B008216WOW", "B00005NCCA", "B00007KUUE", "B00DTCYCAU", "B00005ATSM", "B0002Y67PQ", "B00005ATSN", "B002JEUDX4", "B000035XB0", "B0009I95T0", "B00DTCWNL0", "B00030GS8A", "B000FDKZMU", "B0000A09EH", "B00002SVES", "B00002ST3E", "B003DSASTE", "B00AYBVB44", "B000VXJEW6", "B00008J2UZ", "B0001615OI"], "bought_together": ["B00009WAUO", "B00005B8FZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009WAUO", "B000VBB69M", "B00005B8FZ", "B00005MDZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1518}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Games"]]}
