This full-roaming action-adventure game allows players to jump into the suit of a fledgling Marvel superhero and learn how to battle the forces of evil. Players crawl, leap, and swing from the dizzying heights of skyscrapers to catch criminals and supervillains, and, ultimately, come face-to-face with the Green Goblin in a death-defying display of aerial combat. During the course of the game, players must use Spider-Man's spider-sense, agility, quick wits, and strength to evade the pursuit of the bad guys and overcome obstacles.", "price": 26.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W7FPPA4ML._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N09Q6", "B000ERVLZ2", "B000M4H6RE", "B000TG72SS", "B00008DHNV", "B0015Z1I4G", "B000FDDN2E", "B00004TBGT", "B0002RQ3I4", "B0007M2266", "B00104KJ42", "B001814QDW", "B002BUUM3M", "B00008NRM7", "B001MW91IW", "B0026FCAR8", "B000C4088I", "B0007RDM4M", "B00006Z7HU", "B0002EJ8FC", "B00004YRQA", "B0000640A2", "B000TLU67W", "B00005CF9L", "B00005BZC7", "B003OPX7K8", "B0000C7GHG", "B0013KW1B2", "B000066TS5", "B000ANPQLU", "B000MMLNNE", "B00000IZS1", "B0000AHRPM", "B0000A289C", "9629971372", "B0000A0MDV", "B00004YRQ9", "B00005NCCI", "B00005BK7X", "B00006IJJM", "B00005V6BP", "B000TYQL1O", "B0002IQCSY", "B0002I0UH8", "B0000VSH3G", "B00005R5PO"], "bought_together": ["B0038N09Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0015Z1I4G", "B00004TBGT", "B001MW91IW", "B0009A4EVM"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4548}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"]]}
