Paint them to match your decor and they practically disappear, leaving you with nothing but high-performance sound.Installation is easy as 1-2-3: cut a single hole, feed the wires through to your receiver or amplifier, and simply drop the speaker in. Rotating cams secure the speakers safely with no extra assembly or mess. A round shape and flush design allows each RC60ito mimic the look of a recessed lighting fixture, providing the ultimate in stealth sound.The pair is durable, too, with moisture-resistant materials that are perfectly safe for use in bathrooms, kitchens, saunas--even under outdoor eaves. Rubber driver surrounds outlast cheap foam surrounds for years of trouble-free performance.Dynamic Balance components and aimable tweeters ensure spacious imaging with stunning clarity and well-balanced sound in any listening position, not just a small \"sweet spot.\" Wide-dispersion design means you'll enjoy even coverage across small and large rooms alike.The speakers use large, 6.5-inch cones for rich, full-bodied sound. Further, their Infinite Baffle tuning uses the virtual enclosure of in-wall space to enhance their bass response. The speakers are timbre-matched to the members of Polk's RTiSeries for seamless, enveloping sound when used as part of a home theater. It is 2-way speaker.What's in the BoxTwo speakers, paint masks, and a user's manual."}
