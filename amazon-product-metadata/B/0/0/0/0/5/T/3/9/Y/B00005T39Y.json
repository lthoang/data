While this Sony product works best with Sony CD and MD players, the adaptor will operate with non-Sony products as well. There are a couple of key features to this adaptor which make it a fine choice. The first notable feature is the spring-loaded head. The head will automatically adjust itself to your vehicle's cassette deck, ensuring that the two heads have optimum contact and transfer the best possible sound. The second key feature is the silent mechanism. A silent mechanism yields less operational noise and a better quality MD or CD sound. This adaptor works with all cassette players which require you to insert the tape opening facing the side. The mini-plug inserts into a portable CD or MD headphone jack. The cassette adaptor is a cheap way to make your vehicle CD and MD operational.What's in the BoxSony CPA-9C Cassette Adaptor", "title": "Walkman Car Connecting Pack for MD Walkman and CD Walkman (Model# CPA-9C)", "price": 15.75, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AY-IteIhL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Sony", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005T3ZI6E", "B00EABJCZO", "B0007R4LI8", "B0006G10V6", "B006SU0SX0", "B004V71MXW", "B002DW92IE", "B003FWEQDM", "B005ASY23I", "B004G8KFN4", "B00I0DL2OC", "B0002V9IFU", "B0030APVWO", "B00GJFGE3W", "B007FHX9OK", "B009UEBQIM", "B001CQTLJM", "B00CFM0P7Y"], "bought_together": ["B005T3ZI6E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007R4LI8", "B002DW92IE", "B00KLZMZGQ", "B0044FUQJW"]}}
