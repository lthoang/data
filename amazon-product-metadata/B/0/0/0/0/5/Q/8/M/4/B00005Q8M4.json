{"asin": "B00005Q8M4", "description": "It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk", "price": 84.98, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W55M5ZTKL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000657SP", "B00009KO3S", "B00006LELI", "B0002CHIWO", "B0000A09EN", "B0002A6CQ4", "B0002A6CPK", "B00006IJJK", "B00005QDPZ", "B00005Q8LR", "B0002ILS1U", "B00007KUUD", "B0002IQOPU", "B0002ILS1K", "B000066JRN", "B00012D0SG", "B0009UBR3A", "B00009PS24", "B00007KQC5", "B0001OK7VW", "B000084318", "B00005Q8LY", "B00007KQC4", "B00005ME6O", "1930206186", "B0002WYUB6", "B00009KO3Q", "B000A15K0Y", "B00005QEFD", "B0000657SM", "B00005BOSF", "B0002ILS24", "B00007LV7Y", "B000620PSY", "B000ARPXU0", "B00005Q8M0", "B00008VFBV", "B00006HBTW", "B00006599U", "B0007ZD794", "B00005BW7M", "B000095ZH0", "B00005V9NH", "B00001XDUB", "B0000A1OG4", "B000070IWB", "B00008H2IS", "B00KVRK39A", "B000L9NPGG", "B00006IJJI", "B000GIPJ8E", "B00006FWTX", "B000038IFX", "B0009XEC0M", "B0007WWYLY", "B00009WAVA", "B002ATY7JE", "B00005Q8LV", "B007RNWUC4", "B000A28ENI", "B000IONGU4", "B00009WAUD", "B0001NBNGG", "9861019731", "B00004S99R", "B00006AVB1", "B000FPM3HS", "B00001OWYW", "B00019AZC8", "B0017KIBAI", "B0001Y7404", "B0009Z3K9E", "B000038ABO", "B000NIJ35W", "B000678MBG", "B0001JSSLS", "B0001I9YIK", "B00269DXXO", "B0000E5U6I", "B00005QDQ1", "B00006JN5O", "B0009XSMNA", "B000069BB0", "B00009WAUH", "B000AOEU2K", "B00001X50M", "B00005QEFF", "B00002SVFV", "B00008KTWH", "B00009ZVI2", "B0006I5I58", "B0000A8VBZ", "B000090W86", "B003Y7RB76", "B004CHLNWQ", "B0002CHJ5K", "B00004W4QJ", "B00009PS22"], "bought_together": ["B00012D0SG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000657SP", "B00009PS24", "B0002A6CQ4", "B00005QDPZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5885}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
