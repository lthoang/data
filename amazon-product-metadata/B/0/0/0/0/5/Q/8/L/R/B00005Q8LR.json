{"asin": "B00005Q8LR", "description": "WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk", "price": 209.53, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FV4Z5HQTL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000066JRN", "B0002ILS1K", "B000070IWB", "B000ARPXU0", "B0002ILS24", "B00009WAUD", "B00012D0SG", "B000084318", "B00005Q8LY", "9861019731", "B00005QEFD", "B000A15K0Y", "B002C5BMFI", "B00005QEFF", "B00006HBTW", "B000620PSY", "B00006FWTX", "B004CHLNWQ", "B00005QDQ1", "B00095KU5G", "B00006IJJI", "B000L9NPGG", "B00009WAUB", "B000AQA9UA", "B0000A0O28", "B000B8J7JQ", "B00005ULXN", "B002L93F0A", "B002L8W5V6", "B0009XEC0C", "B000069BB0", "B0007D4MUE", "B00009PS22", "B000UQCER6", "B00006966U", "B00006LEMY", "B0000A1OG4", "B00K6Z4SUM", "B0000VSH4U", "B000641ZC2", "B00176ZDQW", "B00006YXLE", "B0009Z3MGA", "B000ZEX9OU", "B0009PM8V0", "B00009WAUF", "B0000E5U6K", "B00006DY1M", "B000E36OVM", "B0009SQFGQ", "B00006LU9B", "B000UY2TJG", "B000EHPQMG", "B0000A09EP", "B00009K04M", "B000N1IZOO", "B0000A03CX", "B0000D9SQ6", "B0001CJCE2", "B0009XSMNA", "B00009M98D", "B00433XWFU", "B002FY4AOG", "B0002Y5180", "B00AKIVBU0", "B0001YYNL2", "B000X37732", "B0000E5U6I", "B000A28ENI", "B0000A09EI", "B0017KIBAI", "B00005BOSF", "B000ECX0GU", "B00170UDHM", "B00008URUB", "B00009X3VB", "B0087VXX0S", "B00006JC49", "B003LRXSSK", "B0053BCP40"], "bought_together": ["B000066JRN", "B000ARPXU0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000066JRN", "B0000A2Y96", "B000ARPXU0", "B0053BCP40"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 1190}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube", "Games"]]}
