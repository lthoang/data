{"asin": "B00005QDPZ", "description": "Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk", "price": 138.24, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZX877Y2QL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A1OG4", "B00006IJJK", "B000067DPN", "B000067K2D", "B000A15K0Y", "B00005Q8LV", "B00008H2IS", "B00012D0SG", "B0002ILS24", "B000ARPXU0", "B0009XEC0M", "B00000DMB2", "9861019731", "B0002A6CQ4", "B00009PS24", "B00009KO3S", "B00006LEMP", "B0000657SP", "B000066JRN", "B00006IJJI", "B00005Q8M4", "B0002ILS1U", "B00006599U", "B000069BB0", "B00006AVB1", "B00007E1OC", "B0000A09EN", "B00005QEFD", "B00009PS22", "B00006LELI", "B00009WAUD", "B00006LU9B", "B0001B167O", "B00005Q8LR", "B00009VE6B", "B0009Z3I0K", "B00005Q8M0", "B00006JZDV", "B0009UBR3A", "B00005U8TI", "B000ARJI88", "B0002A6CPK", "B00008KTWH", "B0000E5U6I", "B0002CHIWO", "B00005Q8LY", "B00095KU5G", "B00006IJJC", "B000084318", "B002L8W5V6", "B000L9NPGG", "B0001I9YIK", "B000641ZC2", "B00009YEKA", "B00005QDQ1", "B00006JN5O", "B0000C6EDJ", "B00009ZVI2", "B0002IQOPU", "B00009KO3Q", "B000056FLI", "B00009X3VB", "B00005QEFF", "B000FDOU9E", "B00000J2OO", "B00006FDLO", "B000070IWB", "B00006DY3G", "B00009WAUH", "B0017KIBAI", "B00006HBTW", "B0002Y5180", "B00005V3EX", "B0000A09EI", "B0002ILS1K", "B00005R5PZ", "B000090W86", "B0001OK7VW", "B00009WAUF", "B002L93F0A", "B0008GJRT6", "B00005YVTY", "B0001JXAC0", "B00006DY1M", "B0002I9RQI", "B000620PSY", "B00005QSLC", "B0002WYUB6", "B0009O7HWQ", "B0000E5U6N", "B00005NZ1T", "B004CHLNWQ", "B00009X3V2", "B00000DMB5", "B000X37732", "B00006FWTX", "B0002I9RQ8", "B000930DOG", "B000UQCER6"], "bought_together": ["B0000A1OG4", "B00012D0SG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000A1OG4", "B00006IJJK", "B000067DPN", "B00000DMB2"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2335}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "GameCube", "Games"]]}
