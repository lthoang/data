{"asin": "B00005V8TW", "description": "From a distant corner of the galaxy, the sinister plans of an alien race threaten Earth. Mankind's only hope rests in the world's most powerful superheroes--Freedom Force. Take control of a squad of comic-book heroes, each with unique powers including flight, energy beams, and super strength. Then duke it out with the forces of evil through the fully interactive and destructible streets of 1960s New York. Pick up and throw cars and tear down entire buildings on top of evildoers (just be sure to protect the innocent). Build up the powers of your heroes using a detailed role-playing system, and recruit new heroes as you complete successful missions. You can even create your own superhero team and battle your best friend/archnemesis online. Comic-book heroes come to life in the first action-packed tactical RPG for the PC. Are you hero enough?", "price": 24.9, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61NSJ1PVQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0006ZB0ZS", "B005OGYVKU", "B000096PXX", "B000065UEU", "B0001DLLWC", "B0007543DS", "B00032IYIA", "B002I0HJG8", "B00B67ZTUW", "B00CJ7IUIQ", "B003ZSP0WW", "B007CM0K86"], "bought_together": ["B0006ZB0ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006ZB0ZS", "B005OGYVKU", "B000096PXX", "B000065UEU"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 17700}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PC", "Games"]]}
