This high-performance, L-series telephoto zoom lens is distinguished by such features as an f/4 maximum aperture, an inner focusing system, and a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM). The last two features combine to deliver quick and quiet autofocusing--a priority for many amateur and professional photographers. In addition, photographers can attach and use a circular polarizing filter without difficulty because the front lens element does not rotate during focusing. Compatible with the same tripod collar (sold separately) used with the EF 300mm f/4L USM lens, the lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 70-200mmMaximum aperture: 1:4.0Lens construction: 16 elements in 13 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 34 to 12 degreesFocus adjustment: Inner focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 3.9 feetZoom system: Rotating typeFilter size: 67mmDimensions: 3.0 inches in diameter, 6.8 inches longWeight: 25 ouncesA truly professional L-series telephoto zoom lens, with reduced size and weight for applications where portability is important. Superb optically, it combines a Fluorite element with two UD-glass elements for outstanding contrast and performance. Its ring-type USM is fast, silent, and permits full-time minimum focus, as well as the closest MF of any of the L-series 70-200 designs. It&iacute;s also compatible with EF Extenders 1.4x II and 2x II, and accepts an optional accessory tripod collar.Isolate the Interesting PartThe eye tends to see the whole rather than the individual parts. It also sees what&iacute;s near and not what&iacute;s far. By bringing attention to those things missed by the eye, you can create many interesting pictures. It could be the grimace of an athlete, the grill of a classic car, or a girl against a blurred background. Telephoto lenses can also compress images to give dramatic effects. You are limited only by your imagination."}
