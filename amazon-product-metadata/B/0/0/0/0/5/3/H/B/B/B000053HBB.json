The lens is distinguished by two ultra-low-dispersion (UD) glass elements and a rear focusing system to correct aberrations, producing extremely sharp images. The lens also offers a natural-looking background blur and comes with a dedicated, detachable hood. The lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 200mmMaximum aperture: f/2.8Lens construction: 9 elements in 7 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 12 degreesFocus adjustment: Rear focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 4.9 feetFilter size: 72mmDimensions: 3.3 inches in diameter, 5.4 inches longWeight: 1.7 poundsLighter by more than 1.2 pounds (545g) than the 70-200 f/2.8L zoom lens, this fast telephoto lens is a perfect alternative for low-light shooting or just reducing weight in the gadget bag.
