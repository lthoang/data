{"asin": "B00005NN5A", "description": "There's road rage, and then there's road rageSimpsonsstyle! D'oh! Mr. Burns is up to his greedy ways again. He's purchased Springfield's transit corporation and heinously jacked up the fares. Refusing to shell out for the new rates, the road rage ensues. You'll take on commuters and jam-packed back routes, all in an effort to help buy back the corporation before time runs out.More than 25Simpsonscharacters climb behind the wheel or wander the streets begging for a ride. \"Eat my shorts, dude!\" Careen through timesaving shortcuts and take on terrain including hills, mountains, and forests. Wreak havoc in five Springfield neighborhoods that include landmarks such as Moe's Bar and the nuclear power plant. Busy traffic and wayward pedestrians confound your rage. However, two-wheel leans, speed starts, power slides, and other cool car physics help you release that rage.Multiple game modes let you go head-to-head in two-player split-screen action that challenges your opponent in a race for the next passenger, or you can steal his or her passenger midride! Complete up to 60 unique passenger deliveries in story mode, or take a leisurely Sunday drive through the fair Springfield. A bonus system lets you unlock cars and specific characters, while intuitive menus make this game easy to play. As Homer would say, \"If it's hard to do, it's not worth doing!\"", "price": 34.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MCGGVYWYL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000095ZH5", "B000QB059Y", "B000GDJJP8", "B0000696CZ", "B0000AHRPM", "B0002RQ3I4", "B00005YKL1", "B0000A082Y", "B00097CYZS", "B0009SQF0C", "B00005B70Y", "B00005NCCI", "B00005V6BP", "B000TLU67W", "B00005CF9L", "B00004YRQ9", "B0000640A2", "B00005J536", "B00008DHNV", "B001MW91IW", "B00008DHNL", "9629971372", "B0002CNUN0", "B0001VGFK2", "B0009O7HVM", "B00004YRQA", "B0000B0MNH", "B00005O0I2", "B00008NRM7", "B0038N09Q6", "B000EHPQLC", "B000M4H6RE", "B000GPVUQ2", "B0002IQCSY", "B00005BK7X", "B000MMLNNE", "B0001NE48U", "B00006F2ZP", "B00005UOS7", "B000KCX9M4", "B00000IZS1", "B0007M2266", "B00005NN5G", "B0002IQC8E", "B0000503MO", "B0013JHKU0", "B00004U5VF", "B00006GSO0", "B00005OLX1", "B0013KW1B2", "B00001XDK5", "B000FW4YOQ", "B0000C7GHG", "B0009Z3HXI", "B0002RQ3K2", "B0007KTBB2", "B0002XL3BA", "B00067MX98", "B0009Z3HMY", "B00005NUIZ", "B00005O628", "B000EMJA3M", "B0002CHJ8C", "B000TYQL1O", "B000QAUGH6", "B00006IJJM", "B000FDDN2E", "B0015ACX3Q", "B0009I6S0Y", "B00005NCAK", "B0000A0MDV", "B00005U8TQ", "B000066TS5", "B0002EJ8FC", "B0015MMN6G", "B0007OSLAA", "B000099T2E", "B000I4JJRI", "B0009PETYO", "B000FW87AI", "B0007SL1ZI", "B004S3KB6S", "B00005J32C", "B00000DMAR", "B000EHQDA0", "B00005NUJ3", "B002BWS5QG", "B00006N5SU", "B0009350BW", "B000069BD9", "B00006IJJE", "B0009I6S0O", "B000A32O4W", "B0000AHOOJ", "B000G79YNQ", "B001MW3TS0", "B0014487CE", "B000C4088I"], "bought_together": ["B000095ZH5", "B000QB059Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000095ZH5", "B000QB059Y", "B0002RQ3I4", "B0009A4EVM"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4843}, "categories": [["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], ["Video Games", "PC"]]}
