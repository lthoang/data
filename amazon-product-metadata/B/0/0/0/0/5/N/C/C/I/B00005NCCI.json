{"asin": "B00005NCCI", "description": "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, the first PlayStation2 installment in the Crash Bandicoot series, delivers the same mix of intuitive gameplay and elaborate adventure that fans have come to expect, offering many enhancements and all-new environments and missions. Neo Cortex is back, and he means to rid himself of Crash once and for all. To energize his most diabolical creation to date, Cortex channels the power of the Elementals, a group of renegade masks with the destructive power of air, earth, water, and fire. To stop the Elementals and Cortex's new weapon, Crash or Coco (a fully playable character for the first time) will face five game hubs, 25 dynamic levels, and five unique bosses, as well as a new character that will rock the Crash world.You can complete specific levels of the game to play as Crash's fiery sister. Coco will have a wide variety of moves and animations tailored to fit her personality. New free-roam sections will be implemented within certain levels of the game. These sections feature puzzles and hidden areas never before seen in a Crash game. New bosses and minibosses offer up a Noah's Ark-sized list of new creatures. The game also has an all-new graphics engine that brings vivid life to environments and characters like never before.", "price": 44.97, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KZ3ZTRJTL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CJEJU", "B00000I1BR", "B00000DMAR", "B000SMIUQQ", "B00006F2ZP", "B00008NRM7", "B00000I1BQ", "B0007KTBB2", "B000034DCF", "B000R3O1HS", "B0018YDK8Q", "B001MW91IW", "B00005R5PO", "B00005V6BP", "B0001CJCG0", "B00004U4R8", "B00004YRQA", "9629971372", "B000ECX0FQ", "B00004YRQ9", "B0000C7GHG", "B00000I1BF", "B0000690ZE", "B0013KW1B2", "B000TLU67W", "B00008DHNV", "B000066TS5", "B0002EJ8FC", "B000034DC2", "B0045L3SNQ", "B0013JHKU0", "B00000IZS1", "B004S3KB6S", "B000IZAQD8", "B000TYQL1O", "B0002RQ3I4", "B00004U4R9", "B0032GTMEE", "B000C4088I", "B00005NCAG", "B00001QHW9", "B0007RDM4M", "B000GACEHQ", "B0038N09Q6", "B00006JC4A", "B00004TNB0", "B00005U8TQ", "B000TTXL9E", "B002BWS5QG", "B00005MDZ8", "B0015MMN6G", "B00005NUJ3", "B0018YDKB8", "B0000AHRPM", "B00104KJ42", "B000EMJA3M", "B000A32O4W", "B0002IQCSY", "B0009A4EVM", "B0009F3E1I", "B000FDDN2E", "B0000640A2", "B0000A0MDV", "B0009H7UIY", "B0002IQD38", "B003OPX7K8", "B00006FWUU"], "bought_together": ["B0001CJEJU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001CJEJU", "B00000I1BR", "B00000DMAR", "B00000I1BQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 2207}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2"]]}
