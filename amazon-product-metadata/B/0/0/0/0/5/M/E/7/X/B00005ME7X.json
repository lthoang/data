{"asin": "B00005ME7X", "description": "Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.
