{"asin": "B000AAMY86", "categories": [["Automotive", "Tools & Equipment", "Diagnostic & Test Tools", "Code Readers & Scan Tools"]], "description": "The ScanGaugeII is a 3-in-1 automotive computer that combines a multifunction trip computer, diagnostic scan tool, and up to 37  digital gauges in one small package. It connects easily to your vehicle's On-Board Diagnostic (OBDII) port and communicates directly with the  vehicle's computer. Not sure if your car uses OBDII or Controller Area Network (CAN)? The unit will automatically determine which system to  use and switch to it. The ScanGaugeII works on all 1996 or newer OBDII cars, including gas, diesel, propane and hybrid vehicles, as well as  vehicles with the latest CAN systems. A detachable cable allows for easy transfer between multiple vehicles. Its menu-driven operation means  there's no need to memorize complex sequences, and no tools are required for installation.Expandable Add-A-Gauge TechnologyThe ScanGaugeII has been redesigned with expandable Add-A-Gauge (aka XGauge) technology. Add to the original 12 gauges by customizing the ScanGaugeII to  monitor up to 25 more--depending on your specific vehicle's sensor design. Four gauges can be displayed simultaneously and can help determine  fuel consumption rates, allowing you to adjust driving behavior and save gas. At the same time, keep an eye on coolant temperature, engine  speed, and much more in real time. If there is a young driver in the house or friends borrow your car, the ScanGaugeII can record speeds of  up to 158 mph and store the information for you to view later, so you will know just how fast your young driver or friend was going last  night. If the unit was disconnected, you'll know: An indicator will be displayed in the trip data.", "title": "ScanGauge II Ultra Compact 3-in-1 Automotive Computer with Customizable Real-Time Fuel Economy Digital Gauges", "price": 159.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tl0AEg0KL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "ScanGauge", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007S3K21Y", "B001EO0YZ2", "B000TMCX72", "B005DM0OC4", "B00EEDOWU8", "B0057Y5EFK", "B000NHUKJG", "B000B8JUGQ", "B000CSD29Q", "B00656SMNK", "B004A2IFII", "B000JFL7ZS", "B009VI5W82", "B007PBHF8M", "B005DL3DHS", "B003VCES9I", "B008GRBW7O", "B000ARPVQ6", "B003XECS96", "B0075XI71O", "B005UO70ZO", "B003VCB9WC", "B008720YYA", "B002Z311MQ", "B001DRJNLQ", "B0025289QI", "B0021USOM8", "B006Z59ANW", "B000X380KQ", "B00439Q05S", "B000BQQWKA", "B0010DYFPW", "B004SK5I46", "B000CIIDZE", "B00FOSSPGO", "B00A5UEOLG", "B00FSH0WM6", "B00B1TNQCS", "1934838063", "B004ULN610", "B00LJV9XR0", "B00HJAMBI8", "B004K2285E", "B0002BBP7Y", "B003CEVFV4", "B000AA4RWM", "B007S8M0OQ", "B00431JGKW", "B00042LC9M", "B00042KJQ4", "B0006IX7Y2", "B0007WTE08", "B001GC2LVM", "B000THQ0CQ", "B000BGHYDO", "B000ONZXPK", "B0010DY4J4", "B000CIGE9G", "B006GKFWSS", "B000EDOSKG", "B000AMBHG4", "B000C9SH2C", "B000P55SN4", "B000BUU5XG", "B0036ULEV0", "B005ODAO3G", "B0006IX87S", "B00FSIN0U6", "B003CG9PIC", "B00144CSR4", "B0045K2Q9Y", "B00CTN0RWC", "B0000AY2Z6", "B0006JLW34", "B002XL2IBS", "B003BZD03K", "B000WEMH4G", "B003U4O414", "B001CF1A7O", "B007OW6MD6", "B008JHXF4O", "B0055PH0XA", "B001V8U12M", "B000X3C8L8", "B0017T7WHW", "B000BQW5LK", "B00005N5WW", "B003ZZSD10", "B000C2WF0E", "B000EVWDU0", "B00GQ8WW4M", "B000UOBIZC", "B002Y090BY", "B0028PJ10K", "B000NPPBD8", "B0002KR88A", "B00192JGA8", "B003YJLAIK"], "also_viewed": ["B004SK5I46", "B001EO0YZ2", "B008GRBW7O", "B001QJ7WSM", "B007S3K21Y", "B001U9EY0C", "B002U2E9F8", "B00A6HZKM0", "B000YTOR56", "B0077A57JA", "B004B0C1NE", "B000NHUKJG", "B005FIHL3G", "B00JXOYSWA", "B001LIULUO", "B000TMCX72", "B005NLQAHS", "B00JXPSI8Y", "B006NZTZLQ", "B008KZDCMA", "B005ZWM0R4", "B00EEDOWU8", "B004CSX95Y", "B00AOIM2CC", "B002PYBZJO", "B001P20QD8", "B008U1MOM8", "B00H9S71LW", "B002ICSOTC", "B003IOKPLO", "B008ZDYLC2", "B00JB6K06S", "B007PX8476", "B000EVWDAK", "B003IOITIK", "B001LHVOVK", "B00JXQTHC4", "B00AZ273VM", "B0007LEG2K", "B007XE5LTG", "B001QIYAQ0", "B001QIUGVI", "B00AAOOQJC", "B003Y323NC", "B00JE896F4", "B008OBZMGO", "B0095ZKA06", "B0076KBPNI", "B0094DXPDS", "B003CEQZRI", "B007JSGR9Y", "B005KOZ25Y", "B000EVYGQY", "B000SKQD9O", "B008US9J9W", "B005DM0OC4", "B0002A596I"], "bought_together": ["B007S3K21Y", "B000TMCX72"]}}
