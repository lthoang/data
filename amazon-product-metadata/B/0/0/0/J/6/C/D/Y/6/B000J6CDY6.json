It also creates a tranquil environment with four soothing nature sounds, including gentle stream, spring showers, ocean waves and harmonious whale sounds, making the Sleep Sheep a kind of audio pacifier that helps take some of the stress and crankiness out of rest time.Great For On-the-Go ParentsThe Sleep Sheep is specially designed to be easy to take with you on outdoor excursions or car trips. It comes with a Velcro strap that allows for fast and simple attachment to car seats and strollers. As you drive or push baby through the grocery store, he'll be able to take a breather. And because he's relaxed, you can focus on task at hand, which makes running errands more productive.User-Friendly OperationThe Sleep Sheep features user-friendly operation that both big and little hands can handle. Select sounds by simply pressing the push button, and then choose the most comfortable volume. For added convenience and to save battery power, the sounds automatically time out after either 23 or 45 minutes--giving your little one plenty of time to drift off to dreamland.Compact and portable, the Sleep Sheep stands eight inches tall and takes two \"AA\" batteries (included). The sound box removes if your child simply wants to use the Sleep Sheep as a stuffed toy, and clean-up is a snap--just wipe the surface with soap and water.About Cloud bCloud b, the baby sleep specialist, was established by two new mothers with the philosophy that every baby deserves a sound night's sleep for healthy development.
