Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemMicrosoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or Windows VistaCPUIntel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz, Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 3500+ or betterIntel Core 2 Duo Family, AMD 64 X2 5200+, AMD Phenom or betterMemory1 GB2 GBHard Drive Space12 GB of free spaceGraphics HardwareNVidia 6800 or ATI X1650 or better; must support Pixel Shader 3.0Nidia 8600 GTS or better, ATI X1900 or better", "price": 19.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RRZL6Cr9L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A1VER", "B002BS47YE", "B001Q96ZNU", "B003GSZAOY", "B0016BVYAM", "B002I0HKRQ", "B0013RC1W4", "B002ZJPYHS", "B003ICGL7I", "B00178631E", "B002V14VOC", "B003ZULWQI", "B001C4VU5C", "B0050SZ0SY", "B0016N4A7E", "B003P9C6EQ", "B003Q55Y5C", "B001CC8UBG", "B00503EAG2", "B0001X5YN4", "B001E6DG6Y", "B001AWBYRA", "B002I0HJZO", "B001VJ4DHK", "B005C2D2H4", "B003JVF728", "B007H2V9W2", "B001UWGDPS", "B001O4YSTU", "B002NIP2SM", "B007XVTR12", "B002BXKJA0", "B000B63RSA", "B002I0JAJ2", "B001E8QA2E", "B00269QLJ2", "B002EQEFOU", "B0010EK3SE", "B0042WXQ62", "B000MK694E", "B0076DO5A0", "B0065NP39E", "B0079NGSDO", "B0014UGK4U", "B004FYKWZU", "B0001AO01Y", "B0050SZ2EQ", "B0050SZ0JI", "B005G4CXPK", "B002I0KOSI", "B003EZ1KGQ", "B000PS2XDO", "B008E6ZXA4", "B00006C2HA", "B0037M07UG", "B002SRP9VI", "B000YJ3TR8", "B004RLH5CY", "B004CD9X2W", "B003L8DXS4", "B001LKM0EW", "B00GDDY92I", "B004D8QAAO", "B000MR5EJS", "B004H80TUC", "B000FU2TA4", "B002I0IHIM", "B002I0HJ68", "B0050SZ836", "B0050SWTS8", "B000FJSIUA", "B003TIVSM4", "B00BU3WUU4", "B0016Q4UJE", "B000EPP6UA", "0761559337", "B001D7798A", "B004M2DWGQ", "B00CJ7IUIQ", "B004QEWVTO", "B0029ZBZ0I", "B0012LGHZI", "B000UB3B3W", "B004PFS9TU", "B001TOQ8R0", "B004ML9WKC", "B000PS2XES", "B001ATHKVC", "B003O6CB6S", "B000PS1HMM", "B0000C6EB4", "B00006I02Z", "B002GDRPYI", "B00009P50V", "B00140P9BA", "B0016G88RO"], "bought_together": ["B0000A1VER", "B002BS47YE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036CCNDG", "B0000A1VER", "B004SMUAO2", "B001Q96ZNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 9339}, "categories": [["Video Games", "PC", "Games"]]}
