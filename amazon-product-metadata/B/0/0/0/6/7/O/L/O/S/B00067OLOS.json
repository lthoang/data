The more demanding you are of surround sound, the more you will appreciate what the AVBP2 has to offer.The unique configuration of the bipolar speakers creates a 3D soundstage. This is achieved by having two complete full-range speaker systems on opposing sides of the cabinet. The results are widespread, enveloping surround sound throughout your room. The AVBP2 are designed for placement beside or behind the listeners for an extremely convincing 5.1/6.1/7.1 surround ambiance. The trapezoidal configuration of the bipolar speakers is the right choice in fully experiencing amazing cinema-quality surround sound. Made with audio-grade MDF wood cabinetry for reduced resonance, the AVBP2's provide crystal clear, full-range sound performances.With high reproduction qualities in music and home theater, the AVBP2 is perfect for use as dedicated rear channel surrounds. Only premium components - such as Neodymium tweeters - are used in the production of this system. The Neodymium balanced pure silk dome tweeters provide a smooth and accurate projection of the high frequency portions of the signal, contributing to a pure listening experience.What's IncludedTwo black ash bipolar surround sound satellite speakers, full lifetime parts and labor manufacturer's direct warranty."}
