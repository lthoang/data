The Feldkamp brand has been marketed more towards the specialty food markets and natural food stores as opposed to the larger supermarket chains. It is also more consistent in regards to retail price across the board. On the international front Feldkamp has profited from the trend towards traditionally made products, being a healthy, 100 percent Natural addition to the Mestemacher umbrella."}
