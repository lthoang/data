{"asin": "B000HEB3UU", "description": "Kirby&apos;s back and ready for a bellyful of adventure, in Kirby Squeek Squad. When someone steals some strawberry shortcake, the pink powerhouse sets out after them, learning new skills. All the classic floating, jumping and battling of a classic Kirby game are here, but with a massive boost. You&apos;ll mix and match abilities that Kirby copies, by using the stylus to drag them together inside Kirby&apos;s belly (located on the touch screen). The powers themselves now have the ability to affect the environment, as well as foes. Burn trees and grasses with the Fire ability, freeze water with the Ice ability. In sub-game mode, this game also features multiplayer fun for up to four players, using either Multi-Card or DS Download Play over DS Local Area Network.", "price": 81.51, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GM59LvD4L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00095LIC0", "B001C58T5U", "B0050SVOXE", "B00027NWRY", "B00I5LMSE2", "B000070IW6", "B000HE7KZC", "B006JUYYWA", "B001V135P4", "B0050SVGW8", "B000CNESHG", "B008GFZV6Y", "B001TOQ8WU", "B00006JU7G", "B000B8J7K0", "B003ZCH7DI", "B000LSKXRQ", "B001KBYU0E", "B0006B0O9U", "B000FW57OC", "B00FMIPMF8", "B000FRV2UK", "B003FBL86Q", "B00009WAUB", "B00KH57THK", "B000PTYKSY", "B0007D4MVS", "B002WJI67G", "B0007D4MWC", "B001TOQ8UW", "B00JM3R6M6", "B00005AYE5", "B0000897DR", "B00KI2OZ9M", "B000LLUXDW", "B000FW64OY", "B00163ROMW", "B000GABTVS", "B0001615OI", "B0014567UW", "B000ERVMI8", "B005DEMYMK", "B008H7A1BG", "B0000A09EP", "B00005MI42", "B002FCEVYM", "B000QTD05W", "B00DC7G3Q8", "B002I0EPP6", "B00FMIU046", "B006JUXL8S", "B006JUOHR2", "B00FMIZL8Q", "B001O1PAMC", "B002I0EMBI", "B00FMIXVGK", "B008YE71Z6", "B004FNFOPY", "B0009SQFHK", "B004NRN5DK", "B001AF1NVY", "B0014DHIL6", "B003O6E800", "B003ZHQH02", "B000U34SZA", "B00005MO5G", "B000R481R8", "B000MJB0H6", "B000GA8UAQ", "B000035XB0", "B00D41GCUY", "B00012BSJ4", "B00CH923NE", "B00006M3R6", "B002I092MM", "B000FMQS9K", "B0008FPJJO", "B0053B5RGI", "B00009WAUO", "B00FY7YNPW", "B001E27DLM", "B000E9TBRK", "B001C58T46", "B000A2R54M", "B0088MVPFQ", "B007I81C72", "B004Y39JMO", "B0013B30SE", "B00005UK88", "B00DD0B1R0", "B00008KT7R"], "bought_together": ["B0050SVOXE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050SVOXE", "B00I5LMSE2", "B001C58T5U", "B000ERVMI8"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 5214}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family", "Nintendo DS", "Games"], ["Video Games", "Nintendo DS", "Games"]]}
