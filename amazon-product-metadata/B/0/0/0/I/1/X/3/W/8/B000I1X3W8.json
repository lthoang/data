The L-series lens offers an Image Stabilizer that provides up to four stops of shake correction--a first for Canon IS lenses. The use of fluorite UD lens elements, meanwhile, produces an excellent optical performance in terms of resolution and contrast. Add in a sturdy housing with water- and dust-proof construction and you have a lens that's both portable and high performing. Other details include an f/4 maximum aperture, a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM) that enables quick and quiet autofocusing, compatibility with circular polarizing filters, and a lightweight body. The lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 70-200mmMaximum aperture: f/4Lens construction: 20 elements in 15 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 34 to 12 degrees (with full-frame cameras)Focus adjustment: AF with full-time manual focusClosest focusing distance: 3.94 feetZoom system: 7-group helical zoom (72-degree rotational angle)Filter size: 67mmDimensions: 3 inches in diameter, 6.8 inches longWeight: 26.8 ouncesMTF ChartsHigh-performance, L-series telephoto zoom lens combining light weight and compactness with an f4 maximum aperture. Inner focusing and the ring USM enable quick and quiet autofocusing. Also, a circular polarizing filter can be attached and used without difficulty because the front lens element does not rotate during focusing. The tripod collar (sold separately) is the same one used with the EF 300mm f4L USM.", "title": "Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras", "brand": "Canon", "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cnOTxWgjL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BZL8H", "B0054ENDO2", "B0000BZL83", "B0097CZH1O", "B002W2Y8PC", "B000WZ7Y5C", "B00009R6WO", "B001KELVS0", "B0040X4PUE", "B0000BZLBQ", "B001CCAISE", "B00009XVCZ", "B007FH1KX2", "B00004ZCJK", "B009B0MZ8U", "B009B0MZG2", "B004OVE18I", "B002NEGTSI", "B00DMS0GTC", "B000AZ57M6", "B0012FMX34", "B00K8942SO", "B00007GQLU", "B00004ZCFQ", "B007FGYZFI", "B00A2BVAN8", "B0000BZLAC", "B000CLNHXY", "B000NP46K2", "B0076BNK30", "B0000BZL68", "B002C6QC3E", "B00I4DXJVC", "B004NCRYZK", "B00013MSV0", "B0049XGNKK", "B009QPJ2OA", "B0000BZL9J", "B009EM694G", "B00A2BWAY6", "B000A1SWOA", "B0037NX6JY", "B001G7PMMW", "B004KJE8GY", "B00894YP00", "B00004ZCI3", "B0083Z6R4W", "B00JPL7CK6", "B000EW8074", "B00J0JB6KK", "B003CIUV0G", "B00B30N7AQ", "B0027JM35M", "B00K899B9Y", "B00009R6WW", "B007FH1LJU", "B00004ZCFP", "B003Y30334", "B0040JHVCC", "B007M54E1M", "B00AA48DVO", "B00009USW3", "B004V97MXE", "B00017LSPI", "B0009K50VA", "B0041MY32Y", "B00004ZCJM", "B000KL5T9G", "1285084535", "B00443RRVY", "B009IY72OQ", "B007FH1FZ0", "B002KDS2BY", "B002WR7VSS", "B00009XVA3", "B000PTFDYO", "B000KZ5YWE", "B004OR15LI", "B004OVE188", "B0002Y5WXE", "B005DEHVC8", "B007FGZ1V0", "B002WE4H8I", "B0048IW030", "B00111UX40", "0321908570", "B00009R6KN", "B004AH10K8", "B00009R9EO", "B00007E7JU", "1285446569", "B00FW6TN3M", "1285874110", "B007NDL56A", "B000I1YIDQ", "B00009R6VZ", "B001E3ZNL8", "B00A2BWBNQ", "0988263424", "B0045JAJR6"], "bought_together": ["B0000BZL8H", "B0000BZL83"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000053HH5", "B0000BZL8H", "B0000BZLBQ", "B0033PRWSW"]}}
