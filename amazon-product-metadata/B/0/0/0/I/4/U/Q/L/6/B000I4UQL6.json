DDR2 memory features faster speeds, greater bandwidth, lower power consumption and enhanced thermal performance. Although DDR2 modules are the same physical dimension as DDR modules, the plug-in connector configuration is different and as such DDR2 modules are not compatible with PCs requiring DDR modules, and vice-versa. PNY manufactures DDR2 memory upgrades rated at PC2-3200, PC2-4200, PC2-5300 and higher. They are compatible with desktop and notebook computers and processors including Intel`s Pentium, Celeron, Centrino, AMD`s Athlon and Sempron Socket AM2 processors, and others.
