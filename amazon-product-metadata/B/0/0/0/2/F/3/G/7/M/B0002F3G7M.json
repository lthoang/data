Attach these high gain antennas to your Linksys Wireless Broadband Router or Access Point, and increase both the effective strength of the outgoing signals, and the receive sensitivity for incoming signals.The added signal strength and sensitivity also improves close-range communication reliability because every packet comes through \"loud and clear\", reducing retransmissions due to weak signal reception errors.To install, just unscrew your current antennas, and attach the High Gain antennas in their place.  There are no drivers to install, and no modifications to your setup are necessary.The Linksys High Gain Antenna Kit saves wiring costs and helps to build corporate wireless infrastructure by driving stronger signals into distant corners and hard-to-reach areas.  And it's perfect for covering large areas in warehouse environments, public spaces, wireless hotspots, and outdoor venues - anywhere you need extra coverage for your wireless network."}
