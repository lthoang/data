The large hunting axe is powerful and finely balanced. The low weight head and long handle offers an increase in chopping power. Single or two-handed. Bring this on your hunting trip to be well prepared for surviving in the wild. Use the polished poll to skin your kill. To slowly hand forge an axe takes true craftsmanship and decades to learn the craft to perfection. The process starts with first-rate Swedish carbon steel being slowly forged by skilled Wetterlings blacksmiths. Wetterlings forging hammers have been used every day since 1917 and are still the preferred method to reach the best result. No afterwork is needed to correct mistakes or adjust the shape, and they proudly leave small hammer marks that prove these quality tools are hand forged. Wetterlings axes are free from paint and grinding, carefully hardened, sharpened by hand and polished until they shine. They turn their handles from American Hickory in their own wood workshop, too. 0.7 kg Turpentine Axe Head, Swedish carbon steel 3 inch blade, 6 inch long* Slightly rounded, sloped bevel, knife ground to 24 degree angle* 56-58 RwC 20 inch curved Hickory Handle Total weight 0.95 kg *NOTE: Axes are hand made and eye measured.
