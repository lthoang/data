{"asin": "B0002ZAIM8", "description": "Who'd have thought a music-listening revolution could come in such a sweet, compact package? Apple, again, leads the charge with the new iPod shuffle, a digital audio player about the size of a pack of gum, that mixes things up with the new random \"Shuffle Songs\" play mode. The iPod shuffle serves up the songs you've selected in a different order every time. Or, when you want to assume DJ duties, switch back to Play in Order mode. Carry about 240 songs, thanks to 1GB of storage, and enjoy up to 12 hours of continuous playback per battery charge. The shuffle supports MP3, MP3 VBR, AAC, Protected AAC (from iTunes Music Store, M4A, M4B, M4P), and WAV files. It's USB 1.1 and 2.0 ready and has an integrated USB connector. Includes earbud headphones, lanyard and USB cap. System Requirements: iPod for Mac requires a Macintosh with built-in FireWire and Mac OS X v10.1.5 or later (Mac OS X v10.3 recommended). iPod for Windows requires a PC with built-in FireWire or USB 2.0 port or a Windows-certified FireWire or USB 2.0 card and Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4) or Windows XP Home or Professional. Available storage capacity may vary.
