The A.M.T. alloy has a 40% greater strength to weight ration than standard aluminum, meaning the legs are lighter weight yet stronger than the standard metal used in most of today's tripods. Capable of handling the weight of large format (4x5) field cameras or heavy, long telephoto lenses, The PRO 700 DX offer professional photographers and advanced amateurs the strength and stability they need while its size, and the use of A.M.T. alloy, make it lighter weight and more portable than THE PROFESSIONAL series. A tripod should be easy to use, so that that you spend more time concentrating on your photography than you do your equipment. The PRO 700 DX makes setting up easy with secure yet fast speed release leg locks, gearless center column, and 3 position adjustable angle leg locks for easy set up on uneven ground or steps. The adjustable angle locks combined with the PRO 700 DX Short Column (optional accessory) allow the tripod to be lowered to just 15 inches for very low angle, or macro photography in the field. The included PRO 700 DX all-metal 3-way pan head has one of the fasted and easiest to use quick release plates in the industry. SLIK made a circular quick release plate that can secure the camera to the tripod pointing in any direction, making attaching your camera (once the SLIK quick release plate is attached) more intuitive than most other heads that have squared off or angled plates.Value, today it's more important then ever.
