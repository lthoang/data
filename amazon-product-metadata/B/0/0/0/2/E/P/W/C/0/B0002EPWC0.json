The receiver delivers 100 watts RMS per channel x 2 for strong, clear sound across the audible spectrum--even at low listening levels. The company has lowered the amplifier's distortion relative to the previous model (the RX-4105), to less than 0.08 percent, while also giving the receiver a new layout borrowed from its higher-end components.The RX-4105 uses totally discrete amplifiers for all channels (TDAS) to maintain its high power and low distortion. Use the receiver's A and B clip-type speaker outputs to power 2 different rooms, or to biwire a pair of speakers for more efficient amplification (with A outputs driving the woofers, for instance, and the B outputs driving the tweeters--make sure your speakers are compatible if this is a key feature for you).The receiver also offers a handy 25-key remote control and switching for 2 pair of loudspeakers. Audio inputs switch between and amplify up to 4 additional components, including 2 requiring both inputs and outputs (such as a cassette deck and a VCR). The built-in AM/FM tuner features 30 station presets and auto station setup.Other features include bass and treble tone controls, a dimmable fluorescent display, and a .25-inch headphone jack for private listening.What's in the BoxSherwood RX-4105 receiver, remote control, AC power supply cord, FM indoor antenna, AM loop antenna set, and owner's manual."}
