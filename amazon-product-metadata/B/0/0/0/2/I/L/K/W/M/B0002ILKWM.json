The Apple Cinema Display line features a gorgeous new anodized aluminum enclosure to complement the Power Mac G5 or PowerBook G4.See the Forest and the TreesThe 77% increase in screen real estate of the 30-inch Cinema HD Display gives you the space you need to visualize your entire creation yet provides the resolution necessary to edit in place. So you can lay out a two-page spread and edit text without squinting. Or work with a Photoshop document with room for more than 30 layers in a palette. Take in the whole timeline in Final Cut Pro HD, with audio controls. Display an unheard of 126 Logic mixer controls simultaneously. Or peer into four different modes of a molecule visualization with subatomic detail. Add this colossal advancement in innovation to your well-equipped Power Mac G5 for a very reasonable price.Eliminate Tunnel VisionThe widescreen design of the Apple Cinema Display line offers a natural format   for arranging documents the way your brain processes them&#x97;longer wide than high.   That's why each display gives you the best view for your work. It just makes   sense to be able to display a Web page and its code next to each other horizontally,   or long video timelines in wide format. Apple engineers find that the nearly   100-pixel per inch resolution is ideal for images, yet allows you to easily   work with sophisticated type treatments or just plain email. This painstaking   attention to detail moves the industry forward and gives you best LCD technology   available.Enjoy One or         Two Artful DisplaysThe Apple Cinema display matches the sculpted aluminum enclosures of the         Power Mac G5 and PowerBook. This strong, anodized aluminum also allows         for an exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together         seamlessly. The Cinema Display hovers above your desk on a curvaceous         stand, and hardly requires any pressure to adjust the viewing angle from         -5 to 25 degrees, since the enclosure is the lightest Apple display ever,         at each size. And some ineffable quality of pure elemental aluminum just         feels better to the touch.Connect with Pure Digital DVIGive your PowerBook G4 a second display when you're not on the road. Connect         directly to any PowerBook G4 with a DVI port. The DVI connection removes         all barriers to using an Apple display with a PC, if your graphics card         supports DVI with DDC technology for widescreen viewing.Strong anodized aluminum also allows for an exceptionally       narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together seamlessly.Adjust your Apple display from -5&deg; to 25&deg;         with little effort.&nbsp;Effortless AdjustmentThe smooth motion hinge on your Apple display requires very little pressure         to tilt the monitor to a different position. This design allows you to         you view the display at whatever angle works for your environment, anywhere         from -5&deg; to 25&deg;.Pure SignalWhen you need to manipulate color in any media, image distortion is simply         not an option. Analog conversion problems caused by a VGA connection become         progressively worse as you move to monitors that have higher resolutions         or longer monitor cables. These issues fade away with an all digital signal.         DVI transmits a distortion-free digital signal from a digital location         in the graphics card to a digital location on the display&#8217;s screen.         This digital connection gives you the full clarity and stability of liquid         crystal technology &#8212; with sharp, clear pixels from edge to edge.Responsive FeedbackPixel response time provides a good measure of a display&#8217;s performance         in media critical applications, such as video, 3D and motion graphics,         or even when you&#8217;re taking a break with a game. An Apple display         provides fast pixel response time across the entire spectrum from black         and white, to every shade of gray.Peripheral Devices on Your DesktopThis display includes a FireWire 400 hub and a USB 2.0 hub, each with         two ports.
