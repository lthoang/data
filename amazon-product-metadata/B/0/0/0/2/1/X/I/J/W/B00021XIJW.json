Unlike adding a traditional access point to your network to expand wireless coverage, the Wireless-G Range Expander does not need to be connected to the network by a data cable. Just put it within range of your main access point or wireless router, and it \"bounces\" the signals out to remote wireless devices.This \"relay station\" or \"repeater\" approach saves wiring costs and helps to build wireless infrastructure by driving signals into even those distant, reflective corners and hard-to-reach areas where wireless coverage is spotty and cabling is impractical. The Range Expander is perfect to help cover large areas in multi-story homes, warehouse environments, public spaces, wireless \"Hot Spots\", and outdoor venues -- anywhere you need extra coverage for your wireless network.The Wireless-G Range Expander is compatible with the Linksys WAP54G Access Point, and both the WRT54G and WRT54GS Wireless Routers. It works with both Wireless-G and Wireless-B clients so you'll get the benefits of increased coverage, even with a mixed network.", "title": "Cisco-Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G", "price": 95.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FKFWD4JPL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Linksys", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000SEN9U6", "B0001D3K8A", "B0002F3G7M", "B005FDXMJS", "B000BTL0OA", "B00007KDVJ"], "bought_together": ["B000SEN9U6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005FDXMJS", "B00E98O7GC", "B0087NZ31S", "B0077BB3VA"]}}
