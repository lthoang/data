The MicroMax offers a powerful 60 to 100x magnification range, making it easy to examine blood samples, bugs, and anything else that's worthy of a closer look. The microscope also includes a built-in LED light that provides a bright, clear image, along with a rubberized eyepiece for comfortable viewing. Best of all, the MicroMax fits conveniently in a jacket pocket, so you can bring it along wherever you go--whether it's a school field trip or a visit to a friend's house.Please note that users must hold this LED pocket microscope flat against the surface in order for the image to come in clear and in focus. It will be difficult to view objects with the microscope tilted at an angle due to the very high magnifications.CAUTION: If a user is viewing a shiny surface, sometimes the bright LED light will cause a glare which causes the image to become over exposed and unclear.SpecificationsMagnification: 60 to 100xBatteries: 3 SG3 button cell (included)Dimensions: 1.25 by 3.25 by 0.75 inches (W x H x D)Weight: 1.1 ouncesWarrantyAt Carson, we strive to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied with the quality of our products.
