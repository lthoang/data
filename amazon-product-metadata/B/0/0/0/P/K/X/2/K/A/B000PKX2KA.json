Compatible with most all NMEA compliant third-party software, the BU-353 is suitable for use in vehicle, marine and aviation navigation, as well as commercial and municipality applications such as fire trucks, police cars, buses, GIS data collection and much more!The BU-353's slim profile housing is completely water resistant and incorporates an active patch antenna for the highest level of GPS accuracy. With a 60\" cable, placement of the GPS receiver anywhere within the vehicle will usually get sufficient GPS signal reception, but in those rare occurrences when towering high-rises offer challenging satellite reception, simply place the BU-353 on the vehicle's roof (attaches with its built-in magnet) for improved reception.Since power and data are transferred through the same USB cable from the BU-353, there's no need for batteries or any other external power source.BU-353W Package Contents: BU-353RB USB GPS Receiver (1) Suction Cup CD-ROM (User Manual & GPS Info Test Utility)", "title": "GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Receiver", "price": 47.71, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Aa4jbBF8L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "GlobalSat", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001G4ZA6I", "B00G0PPX10", "B008200LHW", "B00182CIB8", "B007RFW1NA", "B002BFO490", "B003WNHGAO", "0899334113", "B0016O0G26", "B003YIFHJY", "B009SQQF9C", "B003DWK14C", "B001ROB444", "B00897RCM0", "B0039ORBLK", "B006P27MB2", "B003YD9PRE", "B004PK4B2E", "B004Y6MIXS", "B0054MLMLA", "B003YHYIT0", "B004MDXS0U", "B00CVQ3XLY", "1494295504", "B0018YZ836", "B004Q287M6", "B0038Q4AIG", "B000YQSQRE", "B0016O3T7A", "B0035XU7WA", "B00HR1ACQW", "B003LLS5JI", "B00A71CMDU", "B00AOBXK9S", "B008TCUXLW", "B00DZLSEVI", "B000WXSO76", "B00C8NNZ36", "B005RUPU6W", "B00C37AZXK", "B004G2F6H0", "B00EOP1N1M", "0071427880", "B00H03JV64", "B003WV5DMO", "B00CHYOLHK", "B003WV5DLA", "B002UI2Y8Q", "B0006ZIEUC", "B001TH7GUU", "B006Z8MJ6Y", "B00G76YEU8", "B000ZRW78Q", "B0046HU670", "B002SZEOLG", "B003Y6UNI6", "B00AKO3EVS", "B00E1GGE40", "B00EO7JYTS", "B009U7WZCA", "B0097NPQ8W", "B00004UDJU", "B001MSU1FS", "B0007T27H8", "B000XBK7C2", "B005GGBYJ4", "B008WWC6FU", "B000VIA4CA", "B00H6ZE3N2", "B00006B834", "B00020H1T6", "B00AYAZENY", "B00FA7DLE0", "B00BBK072Y", "B008AGUOIY", "B00CJSOYMG", "B000EREM6C", "B009QZH7BU", "B002RCTNKW", "B008ZGKWQI", "B00008VFAF", "B00GGM0Y66", "B00I5SW8MC", "B0085MDF52", "B0009JB7GI", "B00483WRZ6", "B00DU49YOQ", "B00126K8BM", "B000OCFFMW", "B00C28L6XI", "1494861275", "B00BWF5U0M", "B000WJA5ZY", "B005P2BY5I", "B00E3W19MO", "B00A42HTLC", "B000E5BKQE", "B003WOGRA8", "B004TGHIS8"], "bought_together": ["B001G4ZA6I", "B00182CIB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008200LHW", "B003WNHGAO", "B006M49G80", "B00897RCM0"]}}
