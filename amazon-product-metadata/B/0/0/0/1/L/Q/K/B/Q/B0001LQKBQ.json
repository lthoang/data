This ensured a more consistent quality because, as with any crop, the characteristics of a consignment can vary according to climate, time of year and general growing conditions.  In 1930 PG Tips was launched in the UK as a loose leaf tea in soft packs.  It was originally called Pre-Gest-Tee\" but soon abbreviated by grocers and van salesmen as PG.  The company adopted the official name and added 'tips' to highlight that PG takes only the top two leaves and a bud to make its tea.  PG Tips is a popular British blend of the finest Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan teas which produces a rich and refreshing flavor.  The definitive traditional English tea.  The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves more room to move around than a flat conventional tea bag.  So the tea bag works like a miniature tea pot.  This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best tasting cup of PG."}
