The speaker features dual 6.5-inch poly/graphite woofers and dual passive radiators to ensure impressive mid tones and extra bass extension. Meanwhile, the 0.75-inch soft dome tweeter reproduces the high frequencies with confident, silky results, creating a frequency response of 29 Hz to 21 kHz. In addition, the DV64 speaker is powerful enough for almost any application, with a maximum recommended amplifier power of 200 watts and a minimum of 10 watts.Listeners will also appreciate the speaker's elegant appearance, which is topped off by the gracefully tall profile and black laminate finish. For stereo applications, listeners should purchase two DV64s, but for surround sound applications, the speakers perform particularly well when matched with other BIC America models, which are tonally matched to deliver a balanced audio profile. The company recommends using its DV62si speakers for the rear channels, the DV62CLR-S as the center speaker, and the V1215 subwoofer for top-level bass performance. All the speakers in the DV line are magnetically shielded to prevent video interference when located near a TV or monitor.The speaker measures 8.5 by 38 by 9.25 inches (W x H x D) and carries a generous seven-year limited warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxOne DV64 speaker, warranty card, user's manual."}
