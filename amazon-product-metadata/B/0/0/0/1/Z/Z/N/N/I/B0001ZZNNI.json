{"asin": "B0001ZZNNI", "description": "Admit it. You played it. You loved it. It might have been that first game that made you realize what was coming in this little hobby of ours. This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer. Just don't expect anything revolutionary here. The closest thing to newness is the ability to link up with another GBA to play with a friend, but don't worry. Two-player is still available on just one unit. If you're looking for innovation, check out the excellent Deluxe version on Game Boy Color. But for purists, this is the cream of the crop in retro goodness. So, if you're willing to drop the 20 gold coins for this one, enjoy your trip down memory lane.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:June 2004Subscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review", "price": 109.65, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RVDM0VL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009WAUO", "B00005B8FZ", "B00005UK88", "B0001ZZNME", "B0001ZZNLK", "B00008URUF", "B00005MDZY", "B00006FWTW", "B00005BZE0", "B0002Y67Q0", "B0002TB4CW", "B00006LELB", "B0002Y67QA", "B0000A9Y11", "B00005NECC", "B0002Y67PQ", "B000087PM3", "B0002Y67PG", "B000VBB69M", "B000238EJ4", "B00005LOW5", "B00023JJUW", "B00005B8G1", "B00000J9J9", "B000B5MV60", "B000GQ1G2E", "B00005NCCA", "B00005V9NJ", "B0000A09EP", "B00002SVEO", "B00005B8G3", "B002JEUDX4", "B0009Z3MOW", "B000035XB0", "B000EGDEJY", "B000087H7T", "B00006M3R6", "B000AX224Y", "B00005MO5G", "B000070IW6", "B004I8IAR0", "B00002ST28", "B001DL8PES", "B000B5MV6A", "B00002ST27", "B0001ZZNLU", "B00012BSJ4", "B00030GS80", "B000090W86", "B00005MI42", "B00027NWRY", "B0001ZZNM4", "B00DTCWNL0", "B00005B8G2", "B000065SQ9", "B00DODCWMY", "B00005NCCW", "B000ERVM06", "B00009ZOHG", "B000QJ1NS8", "B0006GBCZU", "B00007KUUE", "B00005NCAD", "B00C2VMJQI", "B00002SVF6", "B000047GEI", "B00008KUA3", "B00030GS8A", "B00002SVES", "B0002HDSZ0", "B00005ATSM", "B000084314", "B0002T7ZHA", "B00B8SAB8O", "B0001ZZNMO", "B000R08L7M", "B0001JXACA", "B0000296ZJ", "B0002HDSZK", "B00004S9A0", "B00008DHNU", "B00002SVEM", "B0006SSR24", "B00G2F1HB8", "B00008J2UZ", "B00005MDZZ", "9882106463", "B0015DOOEY", "B00008DHNT", "B0002GTXJG", "B00DTCYCAU", "B00004TEYR", "B00002SVET", "B00008G944", "B000BO5UU0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009WAUO", "B00005B8FZ", "B000VBB69M", "B00005UK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 4800}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Kids & Family"], ["Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Games"]]}
