Specifically designed for improved edge-to-edge image quality that meets the strict requirements of professional and high-end amateur photographers alike, the lens lets you bring more area into focus while providing greater depth of field. The lens features three high-precision aspherical lens elements--ground, replica, and GMo--that produce even better image quality than the original Canon EF 16-35mm USM lens. The circular aperture, meanwhile, produces a beautiful and natural background blur when shooting at wider apertures. Other details include internal focusing, a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM), and new AF algorithms for fast and quiet autofocusing. The lens carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 16-35mmMaximum aperture: f/2.8Lens construction: 16 elements in 12 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 108 degrees (at 10 feet) to 63 degreesFocus adjustment: AF with full-time manualClosest focusing distance: 0.92 feetFilter size: 82mm, P=0.75mm/1 filterDimensions: 3.5 inches in diameter, 4.4 inches longWeight: 1.41 poundsThe EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM is a high performance, water-resistant, and ultra wide-angle Canon L-series lens.
