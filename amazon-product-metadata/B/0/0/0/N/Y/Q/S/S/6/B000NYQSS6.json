Designed to brew and pour with the same container, the Ceylon features a removable filter so you can steep tea to your exact preference. This means iced tea is ready quickly and tastes great, and it works with loose leaf or bagged teas. Thanks to its clever design, the Ceylon also doubles as an infusing pitcher, allowing you to add citrus or herbal flavors to water, juice, or punch. With a generous 102-ounce capacity, the pitcher keeps you in iced tea all afternoon and should be washed by hand for best results. A trimmer 51-ounce version is also available.--Emily Bedard"}
