Equipped with enhanced optics, a durable titanium body, and a sleek ergonomic shape, the Varmint Hunter stands out from the crowd in the riflescope category. The Varmint Hunter incorporates a long mount into its ergonomic housing, helping the scope accommodate a wide range of rifles--including bolt-action styles--while also keeping you comfortable. The scope's powerful 50mm lens and multicoated optics, meanwhile, deliver brighter, higher-resolution images, so you can clearly see your prey from a distance. The scope's most glaring feature, however, is its powerful Pulse infrared illuminator, which enhances image brightness and range in total darkness. The IR illuminator lets you track a deer or rabbit in the black of night, or get an early start on your hunting without waiting for the sun to rise.The Varmint Hunter also includes a number of riflescope essentials, including precision windage and elevation adjustments; an adjustable lit red-on-green reticle; a remote control with \"on/off\" and \"IR on/off\" settings; a flip-up objective lens cover; and a standard Weaver rail mount system. Digital camera adaptable with the use of a digital camera accessory (sold separately), the Varmint Hunter comes with an on-rifle carrying case and is backed by a limited lifetime warranty.SpecificationsImage intensifier tube: Gen1Magnification: 2.5xLens diameter: 50mmField of view: 15 degreesResolution: 32 to 36 lp/mmFocus range: 7 yards to infinityEye relief: 45mmDiopter adjustment: +/-4Detection range: Up to 220 yardsRecognition range: Up to 120 yardsIR illuminator effective distance: 100 yardsReticle type: Illuminated red-on-green duplexWindage/elevation adjustment: 1/2 MOA per clickPower supply: 2 AA batteries (3 volt)Estimated battery life (without IR): Up to 50 hoursDimensions: 10 by 3.1 by 3.3 inches (W x H x D)Weight: 31 ouncesWarranty: Limited lifetime"}
