Enter the Zodi Extreme, the hot shower of choice for backcountry use. Ideal for logging road campers and hunters, the Extreme is extra-durable, with a rustproof stainless-steel water tank and a powerful 10,000 BTU burner. To use, simply fill the tank with water and place on the rugged stove, which doubles as a cooking stove. Within five minutes, the water will heat to 100-plus degrees F, giving you plenty of hot, invigorating water for your morning or evening shower. The system also includes a one-piece hand pump that pressurizes the flow without batteries, along with a 6-foot shower hose with a showerhead and on/off control valve. And the system is a breeze to set up, requiring less than a minute.The Extreme, which also sports a handy thermometer that displays the water temperature, collapses for transport and comes with a gear bag.About ZodiZodi's first products heated water in only 20 minutes, but that wasn't good enough.

Today, the Zodi brand is synonymous with innovation, quality, and performance, and is sold in more than 75 countries. Zodi's systems can even be found on Mt. Everest.
