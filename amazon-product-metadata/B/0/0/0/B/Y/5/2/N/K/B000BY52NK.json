A new color-coded menu display facilitates easy viewing, supported by intuitive keywords to assist speedy navigation.The newly-developed high-energy EN-EL3e rechargeable lithium-ion battery delivers enough power to the D200 to support the shooting of up to 1,800 images on a single charge, which takes no longer than 2.5 hours. Battery status can be checked through a real-time fuel-gauge system, found in the menu. An optionalMB-D200battery pack extends shooting capability, using AA-size batteries (six are needed) or two NE-EL3e's.Ultimate shooting experienceThe D200 is ideal for capturing unexpected or fleeting moments, thanks to the 0.15 second power-up, a speedy shutter lag time of just 50 milliseconds, and a shortened viewfinder blackout time of 105 milliseconds.The D200 is also capable of ultra high-speed continuous shooting of five frames per second, capturing up to 37 pictures in JPEG or 22 in RAW format (when using a SanDisk SDCFH Ultra II or SDCFX Extreme III 1 GB CF card). A newly developed and highly flexible Multi-CAM1000 Autofocus features a pinpoint 11-area AF system inherited from Nikon D2 series as well as a 7-area wide AF to focus on larger moving objects easily.Continuous shooting mode captures five frames per second forup to 37 pictures in JPEG or 22 in RAW format.Another feature inherited from the D2x is the 3D-Colour Matrix Metering II, which delivers optimised exposure using new technology developed for the Nikon 1,005 pixel RGB exposure/Colour Matrix Metering sensor. This system evaluates seven parameters in every shot--including brightness, color, contrast, selected focus area, and camera-to-subject distance--and references this data against an on-board database of over 30,000 actual photographic scenes to instantly and accurately calculate the final value.The Nikon DX Format CCD delivers excellent sharpness, color, and resolution.Professional resultsA fundamental feature of the D200 is a newly developed 10.2 effective megapixel Nikon DX Format CCD image sensor that captures high level sharpness and color at 3,872 x 2,592-pixel size, delivering the right resolution to support significant image enlargements and enable greater freedom for creative cropping. The highly sensitive new sensor covers an ISO range from 100 to 1600, rising to 3200 in Hi-1.High speed image processing is inherited from the Nikon D2x, guaranteeing fine color gradations and smooth transitions. A new Optical Low Pass Filter helps prevent moire, color fringing, and shifting to get even greater colors.For added control, saturation and highlights of a shot can be controlled easily using the D200's RBG histograms on the LCD monitor.In addition, new image optimization modes enable D200 users to produce results that more closely match their intended results, with the ability to optimize sharpening, tone and contrast, color, saturation, and hue in choices including Softer, Normal, More vivid, Portrait, and Black and White in camera.Unparalleled possibilitiesLike all Nikon digital SLR cameras, the D200 is compatible with Nikon's Total Imaging System, which means it can be teamed with over 50 high-quality AF Nikkor lenses, including renowned DX Nikkors as well as non-CPU lenses. It also opens up the creative possibilities that can achieved with Nikon's Creative Lighting System thanks to a built-in i-TTL Speedlight which can serve as master in Advanced Wireless Lighting systems.The D200 incorporates an x-Sync terminal to connect to studio lighting and features GPS support to record geographical data of the shot, as well as wireless functionality for image capture and transfer.Nikon D200 Major featuresNewly developed 10.2 effective megapixel Nikon DX Format CCD image sensor with the power to capture exceptional sharpness and faithful color at 3,872 x 2,592-pixel size. Incorporates high-speed 4-channel data output that contributes to 5-frames-per-second continuous shooting performance and employs a newly developed Optical Low Pass Filter that helps prevent moire, color fringing, and shifting while improving resolving power.Incorporates the industry-leading advanced imaging processing engine of the D2x, which allows color-independent pre-conditioning prior to A/D conversion to work in concert with advanced digital image processing algorithms to achieve fine color gradations with exceptionally smooth, consistent transitions.Newly developed 11-area AF system packs the same number of focus areas available for the professional D2 series into a space-efficient system, with the photographer able to select individual focus areas from 11-area wide and 7-area wide AF for Single Area AF, Dynamic AF that delivers precise Continuous servo AF mode operation for moving subjects, Closest Subject Priority Dynamic AF, and also Group Dynamic AF. All these AF options are supported by refined lens-controlling algorithms that realize improved focus precision, better subject acquisition capability, keener subject tracking ability, and overall improved system response.3D Colour Matrix Metering II (AE)--as used in the D2x--delivers optimized exposure through the use of new technology developed for the Nikon 1,005-pixel RGB exposure/Colour Matrix Metering Sensor. Evaluating brightness, color, contrast, selected focus area, and camera-to-subject distance, this system references all such data against an expanded onboard database that has been created using data from more than 30,000 actual photographic scenes to instantly and accurately calculate the final value with high-level dependability during both automatic and manual operation. Also offers variable size center-weighted metering which concentrates 75% of sensitivity within the center-weighted circle, as well as spot metering supporting each individual sensor of both the 7 wide-area AF and 11-area AF groups.New image optimization modes enable photographers to produce results more closely matching the intended results, with a range of choice comprising optimization of sharpening, tone (contrast), color, saturation, and hue, with choices from Normal, Softer, Vivid, More vivid, Portrait, Custom, and Black-and-white optimization.Multiple exposure enables up to 10 separate images to be used to create a single composite to produce imaginative and even surreal results. Image overlay function creates a composite image in-camera from two selected NEF (RAW) images. The original files remain unaltered, opacity can be precisely controlled and the resultant image can be saved in either RAW, JPEG, or TIFF format.Connection to a GPS (Global Positioning System) unit via an optionally available GPS Adapter Cord MC-35 enables the recording of data including latitude, longitude, elevation and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) along with conventional shooting data for each image.A large 2.5-inch LCD monitor with a 170-degree viewing angle from every direction assists accurate assessment of sharpness by enabling image preview with up to 400% magnification. It also offers RGB information as a single display or separate histograms for each color channel to enable better exposure-related decision-making.A chassis crafted from magnesium alloy gives the D200 lightweight resilience, while an enhanced sealing system helps protect each and every exterior seam from potentially damaging dust and moisture.", "title": "Nikon D200 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)", "brand": "Nikon", "salesRank": {"Camera &amp; Photo": 5040}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TBCWE0FBL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VO83A8", "B002KEJFMI", "1579908861", "B001G9WAF2", "B00BUK4CFI", "0470037482", "B001FO4QHI", "B000CDG4TG", "B000BY52O4", "B005DIYQA4", "B000BYCKU8", "B00065ANY2", "B00005LEN4", "B000BY9CV8", "B000HJPK0Y", "B00D5NLVBQ", "B000ZMCILW", "B000BYCKUI", "B000HGMX5M", "B000VJX7DW", "B004I59W9I", "B001ET5U92", "B00065ANYW", "B00EPMWT1M", "B000W05O5O", "B0049VZ4XE", "B00D5NU40U", "B000KZ70JE", "B003Y5T464", "B0002EMY9Y", "B000O161X0", "B004V4IWHY", "B0042X9LC4", "B00FS0IQQM", "B003L7CMNC", "B0009HN57E", "B00005Y3OM", "B000T9251O", "B005IQSSJG", "B0069R7FFQ", "B002VPE1WK", "B002SXNXUG", "B005J2VAEE", "B001EO6W8K", "B0012OGF6Q", "B0009PEU3Y", "B001NXDB4A", "B001ENOZY4", "B000LWJ1ES", "B001S2PPT0", "B0015U95SW", "B0009GZAGO", "B002WE4H8I", "B003ZSHNCC", "B004UC9HSA", "B00015GYU4", "B008B4893M", "B00A8X6EQ8", "B003G40EGC", "B000CMNL52", "B0033ZJPEQ", "B001G4NBSC", "B0001CNMFM", "B002JCSV6M", "B001BTG3OQ", "B000BY52NU", "B0030UL7IG", "B00007EDZ7", "B0029U7PZM", "B000YZGCIU", "B00004ZCJG", "B00BI9X7UC", "B0093HGD2K", "B001KNP3MQ", "B002JCSV8A", "B001NS0OZ4", "B00508ZURU", "B000F4LMIA", "B004LEAYXY", "1928873707", "B0044BZHW2", "1861084447"], "bought_together": ["B001VO83A8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0049VZ4XE", "B005DIYQA4", "B002KEJFMI", "B00D5NU40U"]}}
