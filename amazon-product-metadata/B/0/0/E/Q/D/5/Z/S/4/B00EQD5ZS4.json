Your kids keep hogging the charger and you really need the ability to charge 2 gizmos at the same time?This sounds like a job for NukePak! Fear not, help is at hand with the NukePak dual-port wall charger. One port (the top port that delivers 2.1 amps) is especially dedicated to charging Apple devices such as the i-Pad, whilst the other (bottom) port is dedicated to other devices such as Android and Windows phones, Kindles, gaming devices and most other common electronic devices.The flip-out prongs mean this is a charger that's easy to pack, and the low-key blue LEDs make this charger easy to find at night without the annoyingly bright LEDs of other chargers on the market.And most important of all, the charger is designed to stop when the charging's done meaning this device is one fiendishly safe device!And as if things couldn't get any better, the NukePak wall charger is also a caped crusader for eco-justice: our packaging is recyclable and designed to be totally frustration-free!So for the explosive results you've been waiting for, there's only one thing to do.
