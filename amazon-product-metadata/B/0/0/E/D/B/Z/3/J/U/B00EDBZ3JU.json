Wearing the mask that has made him a legend, he battles evil wherever a hero is needed, as the one-and-only Spider-Man!   Evildoers don't stand a chance against your little hero and his Web Strike Tank vehicle! This tough armored vehicle is loaded with web-slingin' weaponry, like the capture trap that grabs villains and the stinger that launches from the vehicle's stinger tail. It's just the right size for his little hands, and he can slide the cockpit open and put the included Spider-Man figure at the controls. Give your little web-slinger a tank-and-hero duo with the Web Strike Tank vehicle! Playskool and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.
