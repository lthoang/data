The H4300 model is UL classified with 1/2-hour proven fire protection and ETL verified 1/2 hour fire protection for CDs, DVDs, USB drivers, and memory sticks up to 1550 degrees F. It is also ETL verified waterproof. Comes with a tubular key lock.Note: The keys are inside the security file.  You need to put the file on a floor or at knee level on a hard surface.  With the palm on the lines/ridges on the black handle, we need to put constant pressure down on the lid and with the fingers, pinch the red long &#x201C;button&#x201D; up.  This will open the file.  Sometimes the water gasket seals create it a little harder to open but with use, this relieves it.", "title": "SentrySafe H4300 Fire-Safe Waterproof Security File, 0.7 Cubic Feet, Silver Gray", "price": 85.88, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51minkOG-bL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038MWTTW", "B001BF00VC", "B004FBQAW2", "B0001EJIXK", "B00006IF4G", "B008HZUI2A", "B009GH8KY6", "B009NH5S8U", "B003UK79V0", "B0037Z8K3E", "B0006HXD6K", "B0045WJ8DY", "B001TANFHA", "B002A91E6I", "B000W8J75E", "B000SAF07K", "B0033J4T6Q", "B000QX77WK", "B00006IEZ4", "B000Z8P5Z2", "B003TOBM1K", "B005QAQFFS", "B00BQUURLU", "B00FDMV3BK", "B005HXXATI"], "bought_together": ["B0038MWTTW", "B001BF00VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GE57DFK", "B000LJOX94", "B000Z8T7FQ", "B004IPR22C"]}, "categories": [["Office Products", "Office & School Supplies", "Forms, Recordkeeping & Money Handling", "Cash & Check Boxes", "Security Lock Boxes"]]}
