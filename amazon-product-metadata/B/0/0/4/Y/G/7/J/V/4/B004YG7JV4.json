Originally designed for pilots, the Battery Caddy is also great for photography, camping, travel or home use. The Battery Caddy is durable and break resistant and the slim and lightweight design makes it portable. There are no sharp edges to catch on clothing or bags. Storacell's patented locking system snaps batteries into place; batteries snap into place and remove easily. When ready to use, simply push the battery out with your thumb. Keep fresh batteries separate from used batteries by turning them in opposite directions. The Storacell Battery Caddy provides the best terminal protection at both ends. Batteries left rolling around in a drawer, bag or container have the potential to cause a fire. 9V batteries can be a hazard if the double terminal comes in contact with metal objects; an electrical spark can be created causing a fire. The Battery Caddy is great for a variety of uses including outdoor activities, photography bags, emergency kits, by emergency responders and for home organization.
