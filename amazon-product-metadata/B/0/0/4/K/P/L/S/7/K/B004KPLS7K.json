Slip the low-profile Bluetooth receiver into your vehicle's accessory power outlet, then connect the included auxiliary audio cable to your car stereo's AUX-In jack. The first time you use BlueTrip AUX with your phone, introduce the two by a simple Pairing step. Thereafter, just press play. Your iPhone or smartphone sends the music wirelessly to BlueTrip, and BlueTrip routes it to your car stereo through the AUX cable. Phoning? When a call comes in, just press BlueTrip's multifunction button. Call audio is routed to your stereo and BlueTrip's high-sensitivity mic picks up your voice. You talk handsfree, and your caller hears you loud and clear.", "title": "Griffin Technology BlueTrip AUX for iPhone and Smartphones", "price": 89.95, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 20182}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uo28NOp5L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005EV38AE", "B004LGNB0A", "B003GRH20A", "B0031U1ATQ", "B001EAQTRI", "B0042B9U8Q", "B004GJURHM", "B003UCC78I", "B004G7Q53Y", "B004CLYJ2I", "B00AWUDDWK", "B001C5Y3ZA", "B004X71HXU", "B009NLTW60", "B004VM1T5S", "B004G1L52Q", "B00727FE5U", "B004LUJGSW", "B000PB8CQI", "B000Q9UFKU", "B009OBCAW2", "B0047T79VS", "B00BQ5RYI4", "B007I5JT4S"], "bought_together": ["B005EV38AE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009NLTW60", "B00GJSURWI", "B004CLYJ2I", "B00I4WYXAO"]}}
