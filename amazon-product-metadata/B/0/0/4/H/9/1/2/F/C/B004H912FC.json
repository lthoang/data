This radio is using DSP si4734 Micro-chips (from Silicon Labs in \nUSA) to digitalize the analog MW / FM / SW broadcasting signal base on the \nmodern software technology and radio principles. It can highly improve on \nradio's sensitivity, selectivity, S/N ration and anti-interference.This TECSUN PL-380 with New Function - ETM (Easy Tuning Mode)This function is similar to ATS (Auto-tuning Storage).ETM can scan through the \nwhole frequency band and select all the available stations. However, unlike ATS, \nETM will not store or replace those exiting memories with the new scan. It works \njust like a fast tuner; it is easily tune to the next available station by a \nclick of the tuning wheel. You may find this function is useful when you are \ntravelling to other country! Because you can use ETM to scan through the \nfrequency band without delete or replace any of the memory that is stored back \nhome.Moreover, I found that ETM can scan for more weak channels than ATS. It \nseems like ATS is only search for those strong available channels for enjoyment; \nbut on the other hand, ETM is able to search for rest of missing link.The alarm functions that you can wake by buzzer or to your favorite radio \nstation. And the temperature function can be selected as Celsius or Fahrenheit .Radio Specs:FM : 87 ~ 108MHz (Russia 64 ~ 108MHz, Japan 76 ~ 108MHz, USA 87.5 ~ 108MHz)MW : 522 ~ 1620kHz (USA 520 ~ 1710kHz) with 9kHz / 10kHz tuning step selectableAM IF bandwidth : 1, 2, 3, 4, 6kHzLW : 153KHz to 513KHzSW : 2300KHz to 21950KHzSeven tuning mode selectable:1) Easy Tuning Mode (ETM)2) Jog dial manual tuning3) Auto scan tuning (VF)4) Pre-setting manual scan tuning5) Memory pre-setting auto scan tuning6) Memory pre-setting address direct entry tuning"}
