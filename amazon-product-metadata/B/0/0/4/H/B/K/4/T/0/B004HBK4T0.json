{"asin": "B004HBK4T0", "description": "This 2nd Generation Acase capacitive stylus features an upgraded tip that is far more responsive and durable than most other capacitive styluses.\n\nWhile capacitive touch screens are great, one flaw is the inability to use a stylus. Not anymore! Acase's Capacitive Stylus allows you to use your Apple iPad without ever touching the screen with your finger. Perfect for the ladies out there who have their nails done, people that do a lot of typing and gaming on their iPads, or for those who don't want to take their gloves off during a cold day. The Capacitive Stylus is conveniently sized, and designed like a pen to fit just about anywhere. \n\nFully compatible with: iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, HTC HD2, BlackBerry Storm, Gphone and any capacitive touch panel device.", "price": 19.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31x3%2BUHzcTL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004O9A8FU", "B004O95CWO", "B003ULE6GU", "B000W4C5WK", "B000W436BY", "B0092KRAXY", "B000BUI76S", "B0059KTEBC", "B004TLH7C0", "B0009SOELE", "B0054R4AXW", "B007FXMOV8", "B000ETU95S", "B00BPK597I", "B003ZSHKIY", "B0092KRAXO", "B004VM0SE6", "B008MOHLVC", "B000ETWCSK", "B0064REJ3C", "B004Y7AW0I", "B004HT6TS2", "B0075IQKYA", "B004TRYENE"], "bought_together": ["B004O9A8FU", "B004O95CWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0092KRAXY", "B004O95CWO", "B00BPK597I", "B007FXMOV8"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Input Devices", "Digital Pens"], ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Touch Screen Tablet Accessories"]]}
