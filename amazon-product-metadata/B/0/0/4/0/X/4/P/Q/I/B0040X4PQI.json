It features two Ultra Low Dispersion (UD) elements for improved image quality and reduced chromatic aberration, incorporates a floating focusing mechanism for sharpness from close up to infinity, plus an IS system that increases usability by approximately four stops. The EF 70-300 f/4-5.6L IS USM features a function that prevents erroneous operation when the lens is mounted on a tripod or monopod. Gleaming white, with a removable tripod collar, dust and water resistant construction, and a newly developed Fluorine coating that keeps soiling, smears and fingerprints to a minimum, its phenomenal performance and flexibility is assured. For portraiture or to bring what's far away up close, this addition to the L-series is guaranteed to perform.Technical SpecificationsFocal Length &amp; Maximum Aperture: 70-300mm 1:4-5.6Diagonal Angle of View: 34' - 8&deg; 15'Focus Adjustment: Lens extension via inner focusing and focus cam plus floating mechanismClosest Focusing Distance: 1.2m/ 3.9ftDrive System: Ring USMFilter Size: 67 mm dia., P=0.75 mm /1 filterMax.
