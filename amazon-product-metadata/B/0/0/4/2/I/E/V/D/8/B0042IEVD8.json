Proper application is critical to optimum performance. Squeeze onto the center of the CPU an amount of IC Diamond compound about the size of a pea - the center of the CPU is where most heat is concentrated. Place the heatsink on the CPU and push down to spread IC Diamond over the CPU's surface. Clamp the heatsink and power up the PC.\n\nCuring Time: IC Diamond requires minimal time to attain peak performance; in most cases, IC Diamond will reach peak performance after two hours of use.\n\nStability: IC Diamond is designed for stability - it will not bleed or separate in normal use."}
