Make sure your furry friends always have plenty to drink with the Petmate Fresh Flow Pet Fountain. Perfect for multiple-pet homes, the Fresh Flow is an ultra-quiet purifying fountain that keeps your pets&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122; drinking water constantly moving. It uses a charcoal filter and a silent-running submersible pump system to provide naturally cool and oxygenated water. Includes a translucent 108-ounce reservoir that automatically adds water to the drinking bowl as needed and a 120-day supply of filters that remove odors and germs. An angled ramp prevents water from splashing out of the bowl and onto your floor. Non-skid rubber feet keep the fountain from sliding. Recommended by veterinarians. Use mild dish soap to clean by hand. Easy to assemble"}
