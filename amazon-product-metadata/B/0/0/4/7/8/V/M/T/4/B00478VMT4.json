This phenomenon is called self-discharge. This property is particularly noticeable in rechargeable batteries such as nickel metal hydride as compared to dry cell batteries. For this reason, rechargeables have always needed to be charged before use. New technology has made possible the development of low discharge NiMH making that a thing of the past. This new product's main property is that it has introduced great improvements in self-discharge properties (residual ratio after one year of non use is 85%, in temperature conditions of 20 degree Celsius according to MAHA research). Through this breakthrough development, MAHA has realized a rechargeable battery that can challenge dry cell batteries in user-friendliness through features such as making possible use immediately after purchase or once charged, its ability to be used anytime."}
