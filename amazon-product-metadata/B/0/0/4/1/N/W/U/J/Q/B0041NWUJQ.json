{"asin": "B0041NWUJQ", "description": "LaCie is proud to introduce a new addition to our USB key lineup. The LaCie MosKeyto is an ultra-small flash drive that's anything but pesky. Measuring less than 20mm and weighing 10 grams, the LaCie MosKeyto is one of the smallest USB keys on the market. When plugged into your laptop, the device becomes nearly invisible (extending only 6mm) and can be left in your computer when traveling. Since the LaCie Moskeyto lies flush against your device, you'll never lose it and there is no risk of damage to the USB port, computer or key if the drive is knocked or bumped. Just plug it, and forget it! LaCie has integrated an extra 4GB of secure online storage from Wuala into the MosKeyto, making storing and sharing your files, photos, or videos easier than ever.", "title": "LaCie MosKeyto 4 GB USB 2.0 Ultra Small Flash Drive 130981", "price": 9.44, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31FyBnjmlUL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B005FYNSZA", "B00A3U8L8U", "B002HGFKR8", "B00A3U7VVI", "B00A3U7IS4", "B00FU4X9B8", "B001BAW7P4", "B007V9SNNY", "B00FU4X9DG", "B00IUE7DGM", "B004D2AZ0Q", "B008SA63FA", "B00H3BETH4", "B003DTLWHU", "B004LFNCVY", "B00C6GLF78", "B00FJRS6QY", "B004BLIQDW", "B009CMN3V0", "B007V9U81E", "B00812F7O8", "B00AEGIPD4", "B00F0EZ4W0", "B00AXWOLS2", "B00F0EZ4XY", "B00BPHNEKU", "B00HWL99XY", "B00E9OXMAI", "B004X6AQZQ", "B00FWQTBZ2", "B004H0TODS", "B00347L6I6", "B008MF3FXO", "B005HZZ2M4", "B004D2AZ06", "B008SA62QK", "B00C40YYHO", "B00H8B92LW", "B00E4JUC4M", "B004BLIQE6", "B00HRKAYVG", "B00AEGM1HK", "B00HWL9AJC", "B00AEGFFM8", "B005GJ09C4", "B0041RSDXE", "B005FYNSUA", "B00E3PFDSM", "B00KNO7AJM", "B000JQ05B4", "B00FWQV1G4", "B005C2BNJI", "B007IOHPEU", "B00DYQYITG", "B00DZPUOU8", "B00DYQYJ3Q", "B00C982KZY", "B00DZPUOTE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005FYNSZA", "B005FYNSPK", "B005FYNSUA", "B00812F7O8"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage", "USB Flash Drives"]]}
