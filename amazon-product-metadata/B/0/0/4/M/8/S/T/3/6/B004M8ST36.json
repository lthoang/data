It also holds midsize (7&#x201D; screen size) tablets, including the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, Kindle Fire HD, and Google Nexus 7. This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Slim-Grip Universal Holder, a large-sized 80mm windshield suction car mount base with one-touch lever, and a circular 3M adhesive mounting disk (for optional dashboard mounting). The Slim-Grip&#x2019;s spring-loaded mechanism makes it easy to insert or remove the tablet from the holder with one hand, yet still holds the device securely. Included with the holder are 8 support legs (4 short and 4 longer versions). The top and bottom adjustable-leg design of the Slim-Grip helps keep any side buttons and ports unobstructed. The recommended configuration for best performance for most devices is to use the 4 short legs on the top of the holder and the 4 long support legs on the bottom of the holder. The arm of the suction mount adjusts vertically and provides 360&#xB0; rotation, giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the tablet from any angle. The 5&#x201D; tall robust suction car mount with Slim-Grip holder can also be used as a dashboard mount. It&#x2019;s a 2-in-1 tablet car mounting solution. For mounting tablets with larger than 7&#x201D; screen size or for Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3 and Note 2, Galaxy Mega, LG G2, or Motorola Droid MAXX, Arkon recommends Model SM617, featuring the new Slim-Grip Ultra Universal Smartphone and Midsize Tablet Holder (also available from Amazon)."}
