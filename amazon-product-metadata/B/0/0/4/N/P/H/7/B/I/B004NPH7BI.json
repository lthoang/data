{"asin": "B004NPH7BI", "description": "Intended for Wired Home and Office Networks* The Category 6 cable is the cable standard for Gigabit Ethernet and other network protocols. A Category 6 Ethernet Patch Cable is also referred to as a Cat6 Network Cable, Cat6 Cable, Cat6 Ethernet Cable, or Cat6 Data/LAN Cable.* The cable's RJ45 connectors offer universal connectivity to computers and network components, such as routers, switch boxes, network printers, and network attached storage devices.Built for Future-proof Speed and Reliable Connectivity* Category 6a (Augmented Category 6) is defined at higher frequencies than Cat6. Cable Matters Cat6a SSTP Patch Cable is suitable for 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet), 1000BASE-T / 1000BASE-TX (Gigabit Ethernet) and 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet).* Our cables are made of 100% bare copper wire as opposed to copper clad aluminum (CCA) wire, therefore fully compliant with UL Code 444, which require pure bare copper wire in Cat6a communications cables. Our Cat6 patch and bulk cables are used by major data centers around the world.Double Shielded Construction* SSTP/SFTP: foiled and screened shielding between individual pairs and four pairs as a whole can prevent electromagnetic interference and boost cable performance.Specifications* Cable Type: CAT6a* OD: 5.8  0.2 mm* Jacket Material: PVC* Conductor Material: 100% Bare Copper* Contact Plating: 50 Micron Gold Plated* Conductor Gauge: 26 AWG* Cable Performance: Up to 550 MHz* Cable Structure: Stranded Twisted Pair* Cable Shielding: Screened and Foiled Shielding (SSTP/SFTP)* UL and EIA/TIA Verified* Power over Ethernet (POE) and Voice Over IP (VOIP) compliant", "title": "Cable Matters Cat6a Snagless Shielded (SSTP/SFTP) Ethernet Patch Cable in Blue 7 Feet", "price": 6.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41chjef9XTL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004NPMZ7O", "B004NPL4IU", "B004NPH7L8", "B00BIOFEM6", "B004NPMZOW", "B0084X7QSY", "B004NPL4YE", "B00BIPTDZY", "B004NPOPTK", "B00BIPTPAM", "B00BIPSHQK", "B00HEM4ZX0", "B00ET9EUTK", "B001P8B6P4", "B004NPOPWW", "B00HEM5MZU", "B00ETA24EC", "B00ETA23C0", "B00BIPTUEI", "B00HEM54IK", "B00HEM4PR6", "B004NPOQ3A", "B00HEM4XCI", "B004NPJBJY", "B00CLVAJCK", "B00BJP0LUE", "B002JP92K8", "B0077CS9UM", "B0000BVYT3", "B0047ZFHBG", "B006IKGZNW", "B00HEM50Q6", "B00HEM4RRY", "B001QUA6RA", "B000N99BBC", "B00C2B81K6", "B0002J1LGG", "B00BWBLL6S", "B0088ED6IS", "B00006RVPW", "B000I1YU5C", "B006IKH540", "B00DUYECKW", "B00AQL46TY", "B0089AGMPU", "B00C3R130O", "B00F3I7HNM", "B000QYY6EG", "B00AJHDZSI", "B00ESG5SVI", "B00E5I7UAG", "B004KPGPXW", "B008ABOJKS", "B001CY0P7G", "B006IKGNQ6", "B001E1Y5O6", "B00C2BG7ZC", "B0019EHU8G", "B00004Z5LZ", "B001PS9E5I", "B008X3JHJQ", "B0000AZK4D", "B00CJLEHPM", "B008NCDL3U", "B000067RTI", "B0028B9S3Y", "B0069A69ZK", "B00939KFOU", "B004P5ZAQK", "B000UEAJWU", "B00D4SOF3S", "B000RATBWQ", "B004TLIVBG", "B00EHBERSE", "B0002JFN3I", "B005UBNJ48", "B005H4CDF4", "B00B7JLZSE", "B00F0DD0I6", "B0038KN150", "B00DMJI9TA", "B00BWS87WW", "B006QB1RPY", "B0041OOG9M", "B00DB9WCR6", "B0032FXOBC", "B0007OGTGS", "B003L1ZYYM", "B00E3W15P0", "B0061RJSWC", "B0019HL8Q8", "B003VAGXWK", "B0000AI0N1", "B003NR57BY", "B00C980Z2O", "B00BGGDVOO", "B001EVGIYG", "B004S4R5CK", "B003XM1WE0"], "bought_together": ["B004NPMZ7O", "B004NPMZOW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BIPTUEI", "B004NPL4IU", "B00BIPTPAM", "B00ETA23C0"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Cables & Interconnects", "Ethernet Cables"]]}
