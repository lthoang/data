{"asin": "B004Z6NWAU", "description": "Chromebooks are a unique class of mobile computing devices, designed specifically for Web-based tasks. They differ from traditional laptops in a few important ways:Chromebooks run Web-based apps, not traditional PC applications.Chromebooks are designed to be connected to the Internet. You can create documents and spreadsheets or edit photos on a Chromebook using Google apps designed for these purposes. The Chrome operating system will not load and run traditional PC software like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop. However, files created in these applications can be viewed and edited using Google apps on your Chromebook or cloud-based applications like Microsoft's Office web apps.You store your files in the Cloud, not on the machine.To help make them thin and light, Chromebooks are built without large-capacity drives. So instead of storing your documents, videos, and photos on your computer, you save them to Google Drive (Google's Cloud-based storage service). Your files are password-protected and secure, and you can access them anywhere there's an Internet connection. If you know you'll want access to a file or photo offline, however, you can easily save it to the built-in solid-state drive.", "title": "Samsung Series 5 3G Chromebook (Titan Silver)", "price": 229.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oIrn1U2WL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002T45WXU", "0789743965", "B009M2YNWI", "B005AIJ6J8", "B007Y91RH0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009LL9VDG", "B00FNPD1VW", "B00DR0PDNE", "B009M2YNWI"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Laptops"]]}
