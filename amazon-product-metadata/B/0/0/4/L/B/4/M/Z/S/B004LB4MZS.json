{"asin": "B004LB4MZS", "description": "The GoFlexDesk for Mac&reg;external drive delivers high-capacity storage and backup for all your files using Time Machine&trade; software.  Since the drive is formatted for Mac&reg;computers out of the box, it takes full advantage of all the tools the operating system has to offer.  The drive can also be used interchangeably with both Mac&reg;and PC computers without reformatting by installing the downloadable HFS+ driver on the PC.  This is the perfect solution for primarily Mac&reg;computer users who still regularly utilize their PC.  Since PCs will not recognize a drive formatted for Mac&reg;computers, there are limitations for file transfer between the two.  By installing this driver, users can take full advantage of both platforms without any file size or program restrictions.  With up to 3TB of storage, plug-and-play FireWire&reg;800 and USB 2.0 connectivity the GoFlex&trade; Desk for Mac&reg;is a perfect way to maximize capacity for Mac&reg;computers.  Take advantage of the drive's versatile design, and get up to 10x faster transfer speeds by pairing the drive with the upgradable USB 3.0 desktop adapter.&nbsp;", "title": "Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 2 TB FireWire 800 USB 2.0 External Hard Drive for Mac STBC2000100", "price": 17.46, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dsg28IbKL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003KGBBRW", "B00965HKK8", "B002LZV0B0", "B00HFRWWDY", "B004E9SGUO", "B003IT6PHC", "B00CO1I2C6", "B003ELOSJG", "B00829TII6", "B00829THQE", "B006P1QWOQ", "B004KKXNPK", "B00I6CVR8I", "B00HFRWWAW", "B00GJYD0KI", "B00HFRWXV0", "B00BECKLT8", "B00CO1HUGU", "B00829TIIQ", "B0050SI9W8", "B004QGXOP2", "B003KGBBRM", "B00HQ6293W", "B00AK9ZT98", "B004LB4N0C", "B005IA84AA", "B00H4YGR48", "B0045JLPMO", "B0073SQ4P2", "B009HQHPB0", "B00HFRWXQ0", "B003IT6PHM", "B00B7MT8S0", "B005IA84A0", "B00HFRWWAM", "B005IA844G", "B007IJ7UKE", "B007IJ7T4G", "B005Q310UK", "B001KA9QJK", "B005ELBSWO", "B0045JLPNI", "B00E6N9GS4", "B00829THLE", "B009VQCHS2", "B005XZ3OBE", "B00E6N9HEC", "B0052MNIAA", "B009HQCAPQ", "B005C2BNJI", "B009AP6X0C", "B009HQCARY", "B003SU4BXQ", "B00FRHTTIA", "B00H4XH5IG", "B00834SJU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003KGBBRW", "B0038NCES2", "B00CO1I2DU", "B004QGXOOI"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage", "External Hard Drives"]]}
