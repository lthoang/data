This cable's bus powered single port hub and a premium shielded cable enables this unit to have 2x the length of a standard USB cable.CompatibilityNo drivers required on any OS (functions as a one-port USB hub using built-in drivers). Works at full performance with devices such as printers, storage devices, DisplayLink USB displays, keyboards, mice, and most miscellaneous USB devices. Devices with precise timing requirements (usually USB cameras using isoch transfers) not recommended. Bus powered devices which require USB 2.0's full 500mA per port (such as USB wireless adapters) may require a powered hub between cable and device, because the cable itself consumes approx 66mA out of 500mA, sharing the remainder with the attached device.  Not recommended for USB device charging due to reduction in amperage available to connected devices.Not recommended for devices with high power consumption requirements. This cable will not charge iPads, iPods, or iPhones.Not recommended for home theater appliances such as TVs, receivers, Blu-ray players, etc."}
