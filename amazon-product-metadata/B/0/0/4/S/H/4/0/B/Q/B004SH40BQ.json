Smallest size compared to other products made by other manufacturers in this category. Transmits stereo audio from iPods, iPhones, iPads wirelessly to compatible Bluetooth receivers. This product is Made-for-iPad, Made-for-iPhone and Made-for-iPod, unlike many other iPod Bluetooth Transmitters that are only Made-for-iPod.

Low power consumption, for many hours enjoyment with iPods, iPhones and iPads. No batteries needed, powered by iPod/iPhone/iPad. No cables needed, attach to iPod/iPhone/iPad via 30-pin connector.

This authentication process enables local volume adjustments on the iPod/iPhone/iPad to change the volume at the remote receiver. Sony iPod Transmitter does not have an Apple Authentication chip and because of this there is no local iPod/iPhone/iPad volume adjustment possible to change the volume at the remote receiver.(2) This i10s is less than 2/3 the size of Sony's iPod Transmitter, making this a better fit for your iPod/iPhone/iPad. i10s industrial design is a better match for the elegantly designed iPods/iPhones/iPads.(3) No buttons needed to pair and connect, just plug i10s into iPod/iPhone/iPad and it will automatically pair and connect to receiver. No button also means no additional mechanical failure mode on this i10s device.", "title": "KOKKIA i10s (NEW Luxurious Black) Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter for iPod/iPhone/iPad/iTouch with true Apple authentication.
