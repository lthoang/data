As it is rotated, it increasingly cuts out glare and haze. You can also use a polarizer filter to darken blue skies.A FLD filter (fluorescent light correction) provides the perfect solution for obtaining pleasing skin tones and correct color while shooting without a flash under fluorescent lighting. This filter gives true-to-life color rendition by removing the harsh yellow-green cast ordinarily resulting from fluorescent bulbs. When shooting under natural light, a fluorescent filter dramatically increases color saturation of subjects such as sunrises and sunsets.Works with ANY 58mm lens! Lifetime warranty!"}
