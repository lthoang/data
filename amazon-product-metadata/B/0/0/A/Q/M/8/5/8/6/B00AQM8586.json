{"asin": "B00AQM8586", "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Networking Products", "Network Adapters", "USB Network Adapters"]], "description": "The Plugable USB3-E1000 is an easy way to gain wired gigabit network speeds for faster HD video streaming, gaming, web browsing, network storage and more.Common uses include adding wired gigabit network support to Macbooks, UltraBooks, or notebooks with no Ethernet connection, or replacing or upgrading network adapters in desktop PCs.  USB network adapters can improve speeds vs. older 10/100 adapters and wireless networks.  Also useful for adding network interfaces, and transferring files peer-to-peer over Ethernet.  This product is NOT a solution for connecting a USB device like a printer to a network.PerformancePlug into any laptop or desktop currently limited to 10/100 Ethernet, and benefit from faster transfers on your Gigabit Ethernet network. USB 3 systems support theoretical speeds up to 5 GB/sec, and USB 2.0 supports up to 480 Mb/sec. In practice, most machines will see up to a doubling of network speed by moving from 100Mbs Fast Ethernet to 1000Mbs Gigabit ethernet via USB 2, and could see more than twice that gain on USB 3. Also works on 10/100 Ethernet networks at their native speeds.DriversMicrosoft signed 32/64-bit drivers for Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP. Not compatible with ARM-based Windows RT systems (MS Surface, Asus ASUS VivoTab RT). Mac OS X 10.6 through 10.9. Linux kernels 3.9 and later includes driver (3.8 and earlier require rebuild of kernel module from source). Not compatible with Android tablets, Tivo Series 2, Wii or other non-PC/Mac platforms.  See the Plugable USB2-E100 for an adapter compatible with these.Included in PackageUSB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter with standard USB 3.0 type A connector to PC (USB 2.0 compatible), female RJ45 jack to network, Quick Install Guide, and Driver Disk for Windows and Mac.", "title": "Plugable USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter", "price": 18.95, "salesRank": {}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412Yg5V6w1L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008ZGKWQI", "B003VSTDFG", "B005HARR2W", "B00484IEJS", "B00ECDM78E", "B00BBD7NFU", "B00IJU0K2Q", "B00H73HPRO", "B00CQRA8AC", "B00GYN3XJW", "B00F3U4TQS", "B00006RVPW", "B00DBV28TG", "B00B7FOQCK", "B00F3ZNQXU", "B00DQFGH80", "B00BD9495O", "B000N99BBC", "B005X3E5BO", "B003CFATNI", "B00A0ABQLM", "B00006JI5H", "B001U0EM1W", "B0000BVYT3", "B004GKULFO", "B008ALA6DW", "B0007T27H8", "B001LDKO60", "B001CY0P7G", "B00G6TG5YE", "B00F8LBLNG", "B00879EZJI", "B001EVGIYG", "B00ETD2KGQ", "B00IM6BJSQ", "B00BV9Y604", "B00ASC3PJ8", "B00JX1ZS5O", "B00425S1H8", "B002HAJQGA", "B004O3KEE6", "B00GLJGJTA", "B008S08ADI", "B00E3W1726", "B007L6NYAO", "B00023DRLO", "B0056CQP4M", "B00DJCB83O", "B003CFATQK", "B003QXGXOA", "B004XXMUCQ", "B00FG7MMDK", "B00C2CA3N8", "B0034CSUZ8", "B002JCSCQ6", "B0000AQNX2", "B00C28L138", "B00E77N3WE", "B00007IFED", "B00EHDNAOE", "B0038P1TP4", "B00BWF5U0M", "B002C8IH9E", "B00C28L51G", "B00EQT0YK2", "B004Q2BIOU", "B001TH7GVE", "B004S4R5CK", "B00ESM3ISM", "B00H0FK2A6", "B001QUA6R0", "B00IJ331WY", "B00507GV38", "B0019804U8", "B0031SEMBQ", "B0048U3FMS", "B00DRK73IM", "B00A2E1MQA", "B0098Y77OG", "B004IZN3K2", "B00G1PQVPQ", "B00H09BO2M", "B00CLV5JM0", "B0036E8V08", "B005QWY3PU", "B00AHYJWWG", "B00D601UC8", "B00461G3MS", "B00BP5KOPA", "B0073XD90K", "B00B9H6VT2", "B009YCASUW", "B00EYXZI4M", "B00GAUFLTO", "B00IRV2DL8", "B003NREDC8", "B007N6MTNA", "B00KHR5AM4", "B005BZNDS0"], "bought_together": ["B008ZGKWQI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BBD7NFU", "B00484IEJS", "B00A0ABQLM", "B00IJU0K2Q"]}}
