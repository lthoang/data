Build floors, collect rent on your rooms and play Celebrity cards to protect your own rooms from Bills. But don't just build - double-deal your opponent out of the game. You can give Bills to your rival's hotel rooms so they can't collect rent on them, demolish their floors, steal cash, block deals and remove rooms - but look out, because they'll be doing the same to you. It's a fast-dealing, room-stealing, no-holds-barred race to finish your hotel first. Can you outwit your opponent - or will they double-deal you into loser Ville? Find out with the Monopoly Hotels game. EA Game"}
