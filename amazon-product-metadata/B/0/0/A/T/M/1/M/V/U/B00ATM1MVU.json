High speed performance is afforded throughout the system, enabling fast continuous shooting up to 10 full resolution frames per second and an auto focusing speed of 0.2 second. Full HD 1080i video capabilities are also supported at a frame rate of 60fps. An incredibly long 50x optical zoom lens is also built into the SL1000's design, giving a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 24-1200mm. This range can be effectively doubled through the use of Intelligent Digital Zoom, and an optical image stabilization system benefits shooting at such magnifications by reducing the appearance of camera shake. Both a rear LCD monitor and electronic viewfinder are available for monitoring and image review, and both have a high 920k-dot resolution for clear image viewing."}
