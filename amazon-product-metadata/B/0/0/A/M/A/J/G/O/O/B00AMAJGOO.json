From the moment you plug it in and it is instantly accessible on your network, you'll know there's nothing like it. The Drobo 5N is perfect for any connected home, home office, or small office environment needing a simple, safe device for sharing and backing up data over the network. Not only is Drobo 5N fast, but it's easy-to-use, expandable, flexible, and protected-exactly what's expected from a Drobo. You can safely store and edit photos and videos as well as store and back up personal data. Built on award-winning BeyondRAID technology with single- or dual-drive redundancy, Drobo 5N protects your data without any user interaction, even in the event of multiple drive failures. Drives can be added or hot-swapped on-the-fly for storage expansion with zero downtime. If you're running low on space, the wraparound lights on the front tell you what to do. Just add a drive in an empty bay or remove a smaller drive and replace it with a larger one. Drobo doesn't just protect you from a drive failure, but also from potential data loss after a power outage. Found sometimes in arrays that cost tens of thousands of dollars, Drobo 5N includes a battery that protects all data in memory, or cache, that is, data on its way to the drives. When power spontaneously goes away, the battery keeps the Drobo alive long enough for the data to be written to non-volatile storage. The battery recharges itself and lasts for the life of the product."}
