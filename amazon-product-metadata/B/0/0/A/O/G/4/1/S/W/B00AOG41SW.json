Kids can use this launcher to rapidly fire Ballistiks vehicles as they feed through the magazine slide. The LED helps with aim and accurate targeting, and the trigger mechanism is traditionally simple. Send Ballistiks vehicles smashing into targets, and watch the balls change on impact to become cars; then simply fold up their sides to return them to ball form, reload and launch again. Attach the carrying case, sold separately, to increase the number of Ballistiks vehicles that can be fired in a round and amp up the action. Includes launcher and 1 Ballistiks vehicle. All other Ballistik Vehicles sold separately."}
