It uses Darbee Visual Presence Technology to brighten, sharpen, and clarify video and images, bringing incredible detail to your TV from any video source.\n\nBeyond HD\n\nIt is currently believed that 1080p with deep color is the best level of video quality available to most home users. Conventional wisdom dictates that quality won't improve without increasing resolution or improving other specs like contrast ratio and color depth.\n\n4k is promising to do just that, but it is an expensive solution at best. The Darblet uses patented technology to go beyond conventional graphics technology by processing images and video the same way the human brain does. This adds new levels of detail, textures, and colors not visible before, essentially transforming your entertainment experience.\nThe Darblet takes full advantage of the latest HDMI features, meaning the Darblet is fully compatible with Deep Color and 3D.\n\nEasy Installation\n\nNot only is the Darblet affordable, it's also a very simple solution to upgrading your video quality. Other upgrades involve changing your TV and/or your source (like your DVD player). The Darblet goes between your source and your display. All you need is the Darblet and one additional HDMI cable.\n\nThe Darblet is completely Plug-n-Play, you don't need to install any drivers or software. There are simple controls to set up the Darblet according to your personal preferences.\n\nDarbee Remote\nAdjustable Enhancement\n\nThe level of enhancement (Darbee effect) you get from the Darblet can be adjusted in 10% increments, which means you can get just the right amount of enhancement for any application. You can also choose from 3 different presets: Hi Def, Gaming, and Full Pop. Just use the included remote or the buttons on the device itself to make any adjustments.", "title": "DarbeeVision DVP-5000 Darblet HDMI Video Processor with Darbee Visual Presence Technology", "price": 299.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IxEP%2B%2B7wL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "DarbeeVision", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MZXUI6", "B00CKWI13O", "B009LRR5AQ", "B00H83EV5W", "B0045ASBLG", "B00GPFM106", "B00BWE3KSM", "B0053T5QPW", "B00HWWUQYY", "B008I64CC0", "B00J11U4T6", "B007REV4YI", "B001OOZU8I", "B00HERGM86", "B00K0HDE7Y", "B008XBCJ34", "B00K7IPGS6", "B008JFUR10", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0092QITO2", "B00CALM17C", "B005LAIHY0", "B00JAQJNN0", "B0019EHU8G", "B008Y1YK0I", "B00IYJFB2G", "B005LAIII0", "B005LAII80", "B008JFUNNM", "B008JFUNJQ", "B00HEPDLFK", "B00D9EJGBI", "B008JFUO4U", "B00AR1G3FS", "B007JOO4XE", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B005LAIIN0", "B00GST8UB8", "B00DYEN6XC", "B000NQRE1E", "B00IVLR9LI", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00BEIYP8A", "B00HEEAM94", "B001RIMZUW", "B00HUQC442", "B00AJHBMSS", "B00B11C6HW", "B007EHI1DK", "B00BFO4XSA", "B00JPS6A3O", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B00A2T6X0K", "B004443WRG", "B0038SQQ0Y", "B008JFUS8M", "B00AFKBIYW", "B00D7OMNXS", "B00G0OHMUG", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00IARA89S", "B00AHTYGRW", "B005LAII8K", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00JPFTTTO", "B0090SI582", "B007RCNQXW", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00AJHCSV8", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00GGT4OK6", "B008N9AAQ4", "B005LAIHQS", "B002Q8HQHE", "B00C7JFIRC", "B00A2H9OZS", "B00HPMCO14", "B00BQ5RY1G", "B00GMV8LIO", "B00H7KJTCG", "B00G4Q3NDA", "B00AQB2AR4", "B00002MXUH", "B007PM9WYG", "B00164GDD2", "B009MF56GC", "B005DL2OVE", "B00DHHWY9I", "B00DHS8N5G", "B007TG5EG8", "B0085JBI6S", "B00867GJYK", "B00F144HYA", "B00AEFY9MG", "B009ZW7SR2", "B00DI5AXNI", "B00HT2RTU6", "B0062G4728", "B00CUMJRLY"], "bought_together": ["B001MZXUI6", "B0019EHU8G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B77BYBO", "B00CKWI13O", "B0045ASBLG", "B00GPFM106"]}}
