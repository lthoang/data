A product&rsquo;s &ldquo;useful life&rdquo; means the period during which the  product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required technical  capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of operating  as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed to be out  of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been  downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more. Unless  otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription will be  updates to the same geographic map data originally included with your  Garmin product when originally purchased. In some instances, your Garmin  product might not have sufficient memory remaining for you to load an  update to the map data, in which case you will need to either (a) select  reduced map data coverage for your updates, or (b) purchase separately a  microSD&trade;/SD&trade; card (if and as applicable to your Garmin product) and  load all or a portion of the map data coverage for your updates to the  card and insert the card into the microSD/SD card slot contained in your  Garmin product. If neither of the measures in (a) or (b) can be used to  address your product&rsquo;s lack of sufficient remaining memory, then Garmin  may conclude that the &ldquo;useful life&rdquo; of your product has expired. Garmin  may terminate your n&uuml;Maps Lifetime subscription at any time if you  violate any of the terms of this agreement or your subscription. Your  n&uuml;Maps Lifetime subscription may not be transferred to another Garmin  product.", "title": "Garmin n&uuml;vi 42LM 4.3-Inch Portable Vehicle GPS with Lifetime Maps (US)", "price": 86.79, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hhbvX2apL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Garmin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003DSCU72", "B00INXADDK", "B002VPE21A", "B002OL2MU4", "B004I5BUSO", "B00BB2NLVQ", "B00CO8WHBQ", "B00721CLN4", "B001M09MUG", "B00I9Z7MBI", "B00INXAVOQ", "B0037JE8VS", "B0035JL4V2", "B00CO8ULSM", "B002TLSOG0", "B007RMAS1K", "B00HQC4EG6", "B000LRMS66", "B0096DM9YC", "B0055XNWJI", "B00BXQ0370", "B0057ODG6Y", "B000QRAMNC", "B0015A6YN6", "B001EPX7N2", "B00AXZWG8Q", "B00CRQUKQ4", "B00FR6C5XM", "B003U5Y2HO", "B00006IC8I", "0880801484", "B000LV7VXW", "B00200K1TS"], "bought_together": ["B002OL2MU4", "B004I5BUSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0057OCDQS", "B0057ODG6Y", "B00AXZWG8Q", "B002OL2MU4"]}}
