A product&rsquo;s &ldquo;useful life&rdquo; means the period during  which the product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required  technical capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of  operating as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed  to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have  been downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more.  Unless otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription  will be updates to the same geographic map data originally included with  your Garmin product when originally purchased. In some instances, your  Garmin product might not have sufficient memory remaining for you to  load an update to the map data, in which case you will need to either  (a) select reduced map data coverage for your updates, or (b) purchase  separately a microSD&trade;/SD&trade; card (if and as applicable to your Garmin  product) and load all or a portion of the map data coverage for your  updates to the card and insert the card into the microSD/SD card slot  contained in your Garmin product. If neither of the measures in (a) or  (b) can be used to address your product&rsquo;s lack of sufficient remaining  memory, then Garmin may conclude that the &ldquo;useful life&rdquo; of your product  has expired.
