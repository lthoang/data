A precise dynamic driver creates powerful bass while a balanced armature driver provides crisp clear mids and highs for perfect clarity across the sound spectrum. With the Balanced Armature the midrange and treble can be much more accurate and detailed, and with the Dynamic driver it helps produce the entire musical frequency range. Giving the end users the most realistic sound audio experience.
