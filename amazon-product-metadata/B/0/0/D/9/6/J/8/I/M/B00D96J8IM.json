This remote fits your hand well and simplifies operation.\n\nThe RC71 will also control your TV and/or receiver for the volume and power functions, once you've told the remote what model components you have.\n\nWhen used in RF mode, this remote is faster and more accurate due to the RF4CE protocol. This two-way protocol confirms each button press, so no missed digits in three-digit channels!\n\nIn IR mode, this remote is compatible with all legacy and current DIRECTV receivers.\n\nIn RF mode, this remote will only work with the DIRECTV HR44 Genie and the Genie clients C41 and C41W. (When in RF mode, it will still use IR for TV/AV functions.)"}
