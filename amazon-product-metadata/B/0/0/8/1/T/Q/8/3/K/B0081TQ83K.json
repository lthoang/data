{"asin": "B0081TQ83K", "description": "This keyboard uses the industry leading Cherry Red MX switches, which require the least amount of force to actuate the switch. The switches are gold plated to prevent corrosion and have a life cycle of over 50 million keypresses, which is 5-10x more than that of a conventional membrane keyboard.Typical membrane keyboards, and most mechanical keyboards with a USB interface, only support 6-key rollover (maximum 6 keys registering at a time), but this model supports 64-key rollover, allowing for complex gaming combos as well as faster touch typing with fewer errors.It includes a built-in macro capability with support for 5 sets of up to 50 macros each. It features a soft-touch, rubberized surface for maximum comfort and includes an attachable wrist rest.Each key is backlit with a red LED, which allows the keys to be easily identified in low-lighting conditions. The illumination level is adjustable to five levels, including a setting which cycles between minimum and maximum illumination levels.The keyboard includes a 2-port USB 2.0 hub along with convenient connections for headset/speakers and microphone. It connects to the computer through the USB interface and features a 58\" fabric covered cable for maximum durability.Features:* Uses Cherry Red MX switches* Switches rated for over 50 million keystrokes* 2 mm keyswitch actuation distance, 4 mm full throw distance* Requires only 45 grams actuation force* Red LED backlighting for each key* Includes 2-port USB 2.0 hub* Connections for headset and mic* Supports 5 sets of 50 macros each* Cylindrical shaped keytops* Soft-touch rubberized surface* Includes attachable wrist rest* Includes 4 high-visibility orange keytops for replacing the WASD gaming keys", "title": "Monoprice Backlit Macro Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with USB Hub, Headset, Microphone Jacks and Cherry MX Red Switches (109181)", "price": 119.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MS3MTA0RL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0081TQ8BW", "B00I91X57M", "B009TD83YY", "B00C2MBG02", "B00G505M4S", "B00C2MBG4I", "B0068INSUM", "B00DOWCQ0I", "B00DS3MPHM", "B007VDLVD4", "B008PFABI8", "B001DWI4FM", "B004F38Y7Y", "B00EHBECAW", "B007VDKLLM", "B00IYJD5CY", "B00IVEGSIA", "B005QW1UBU", "B00IG3GSQ8", "B00A378L10", "B00CERXJNW", "B00CD1FC6G", "B00BBUCCKO", "B00IG3GPC0", "B00DQ5RGOY", "B00D78Q4UM", "B0038X3ZVM", "B009SJR28W", "B00IG3GP84", "B00JZC972Q", "B00CEZQ8FA", "B00ELNG49I", "B00IZXXF92", "B00H4DOFE8", "B003VAK16O", "B0051XWXCE", "B005QW1THA", "B00DIGBSEA", "B00FB4BUMM", "B002ZV51DI", "B00A378L4C", "B008PFDUW2", "B009C98NPY", "B00C2MBG2U", "B00DKXXAAQ", "B00EI52VCS", "B002RRLQIO", "B003M4XGI4", "B00AQMUE30", "B0095OXG1C", "B00HZE2PJS", "B005QW1UME", "B00IG3GPTS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009C98NPY", "B00CD1FC6G", "B0081TQ8BW", "B003VAGXWK"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories", "Keyboards"]]}
