The cleverest builders reap the greatest rewards. Players build a number of buildings together to cover as large an area as possible and be as tall as possible. The money received in return is calculated from the area times the height of a building section. Whenever a storey is completed, money is paid to the player who completed it. With all this construction going on, buildings can merge and result in a Casa Grande."}
