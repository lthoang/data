The improved focusing system combined with superior optical quality that contains extra low dispersion glass creates a 3D view of the smallest particles on your sensor. These enhancements make it even easier to spot the smallest particles that can contaminate your sensor.\n\nUtilizing advanced features such as BriteVue technology with high optical magnification and 6 super bright LEDs, the Quasar Sensor Loupe 7x is the only tool you need for locating debris on your sensor. The high-quality optical glass is coated with MgF2 to reduce chromatic aberrations and to seal the lens so that no mildew buildup occurs.\n\nThe high caliber materials used in construction of the Quasar Sensor Loupe 7x provide a high resolution, distortion free, crystal clear image of the sensor. The BriteVue design aids to easily spot dust on the sensor, succeeding where other tools fail. The angled configuration of the 6 intensely lit LEDs, similar to that used in satellite imaging, provides a three dimensional image of the debris as opposed to linear lights of ordinary loupes on the market.\n\nThe Quasar Sensor Loupe 7x from Visible Dust makes it easier than ever before in locating even the smallest dust speck without resorting to time consuming inspection through a computer monitor. The unit operates with the included two CR2025/2032 lithium batteries and comes in a handy hand case.", "title": "Visible Dust BriteVue Sensor Loupe 7X", "price": 89.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5173ho-yesL._SX300_.jpg", "brand": "VisibleDust", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019K8YVM", "B004OPWQEA", "B0029WUKVG", "B001AFV9CM", "B000T8YG2Q", "B000NYDNXE", "B00017LSPI", "B004WBR8C6", "B001BA93JW", "B000LQQQZQ", "B001QUIEIS", "B001B9RI5O", "B001F1Q8ZY", "B001RTS3OI", "B002XJ5FL0", "B0033UQM6K", "B000IBUXNK", "B000F6VRJC", "B001R2W47M", "B0001M6K24", "B000PNJL6G", "B00JPD0UQW", "B000PNGM18", "B004DAE7UC", "B000RGI9OG", "B002XJ02JA", "B00EI7OB2O", "B00IAYFDIC", "B0045KGZOG", "B007TIYZ3Y", "B000VDCTCI", "B0091SS310", "B000A6EXNO", "B007G5NNOW", "B002XJ3JL8", "B009YYFY4K", "B002NUIPTS", "B00K7O2DJU", "B000BWRIE8", "B005PCDSBQ", "B0081ER9KG", "1937538192", "B000G01UHG", "1285428331", "B005UEB5TQ", "B0038OIW00", "B0007M6GI6", "B005UEB6OK", "B00AA478UQ", "B004TAA4OY", "B000L9OIQC", "B000VDCT3C", "B003LA595M", "B000EB4HLI", "B001BCCLIA", "B001T9NXA0", "B000KZ70JE", "B009TL1XS4", "B007FH1KX2", "B000JLM3PA", "B0050C9ZMC", "B0018KXPEO", "B007FEFQDA", "B0009M1O9A", "B007NDL56A", "B0040X4PUE", "B003KIIQYG", "B000LC5V9M", "B0049H89F8", "B007BXD66E", "B00A0VMLQU", "B00HXAV0X6", "B0030E4UIQ", "B000AW3CY4", "B006UOYXMQ", "B0000BZLBQ", "B0001HMFI2", "B0099Y1QM4", "B000E5CVAI", "B005MYAHJ8", "B004Z55VP0", "B00BOZ1Y46", "B0009M1BRU", "B007BZRXJ8", "B007M4FFKW", "B0045TYDNC", "B0000BZLAC", "B0099XGZXA", "B001BCFF2E", "B002P370AI", "1118509307", "B007C0VHTE", "B00006JN3G", "B009VZOK0Q", "B001KELVS0", "0500543992", "B006U49XM6", "B00A0TLDSY"], "bought_together": ["B00017LSPI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0091SS310", "B00017LSPI", "B0029WUKVG", "B0019K8YVM"]}}
