It features some great new features that are not available on Rokinon's first highly rated 8mm f/3.5 fisheye lens. Optics and glass are high definition (HD) with very clear & sharp images. This lens also features a removable hood which can make it easier for use on full frame cameras. While this lens is designed for APS-C sensors, full frame users can now use it comfortable without the hood. On APS-C cameras, the pictures will fill the entire frame or screen. On full frame cameras, the lens will produce pictures with a semi-circular image and close images will appear proportionately large for a dramatic effect.", "title": "Rokinon HD8M-S 8mm f/3.5 HD Fisheye Lens with Removeable Hood for Sony Alpha DSLR 8-8mm, Fixed-Non-Zoom Lens", "price": 257.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wQM2-xjHL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Elite Brands Inc", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003LYKLCO", "B0016120M8", "B000UPNQCY", "B0012DHL10", "B00B7ID9CU", "B0042GHI8U", "B00C1VEQFG", "1133597130", "B00BXA7N6A", "B003MQWN40", "B0025F4HTS", "B003M32CQM"], "bought_together": ["B003LYKLCO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002LU3DLA", "B009AC97CG", "B003MQWN40", "B002VPE1WK"]}}
