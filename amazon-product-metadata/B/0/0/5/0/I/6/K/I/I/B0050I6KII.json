{"asin": "B0050I6KII", "description": "The KCA Kable (Kolossus Copper Aluminum) is the next generation of our Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) power and ground cables. Succeeding its fellow KLM and KLMX models before it, the new KCA 4 Gauge uses the same of 29.44mm^2 of Copper Clad Aluminim (CCA) as previous models. Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA) is made up of 90% Aluminum and 10% Copper. The KCA Kable is equal in size to the Kolossus Kable, but is designed for lighter current loads and not lightening your wallet.The KCA 4 Gauge Kable used throughout this kit offers incredible flexibility and a rugged PVC outer jacket that is impervious to grease and oil. The PVC outer jacket can with-stand the extreme temperatures (-40 to 105 C).Additional matching 2 Channel Bassik 5 Meter RCA's are available on Amazon should you need one for a 4 channel installationBeware of \"1600 Watt\" amp kits that include a 50 or 60A fuse. Its physically impossible for these kits to support this load (refer to our comparison photo)How many watts can this amp kit handle?At KnuKonceptz, we do not use \"watts\" to rate our amp kits. This is a very inaccurate method to determine what the proper gauge wire required for your amp installation. There are many amp manufactures and not all of them represent the output of their product accurately. Please refer to your amplifier's fuse rating, this is a number a manufacture can not fake, well they could but it would put their product in harms way! Add up the fuses on the end of your amp (two 30A fuses = 60A total draw) If this number is under 80A, this kit will fit your application. If over 80A, a larger gauge wire would be required or use our Kolossus Flex 4 gauge amp installation kit.Visit our website to see a complete head to head amp kit review from top sellers on Amazon vs KnuKonceptz.", "title": "KnuKonceptz KCA Complete 4 Gauge Amp Installation Kit", "price": 26.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51v-IV8NmXL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DJ7JKE8", "B00BMR7UPS", "B00BF6HYDE", "B001EAWS3W", "B00CFX58YI", "B003KEGS90", "B00E1BRITU", "B00D3NJ5B6", "B0009N7RMM", "B007XW2WTK", "B007VSXGOQ", "B000P0R6LQ", "B00CXX97TW", "B005IY3BI6", "B00BNANG1Q", "B00786XNS0", "B0037ZRP7G", "B0081K3M5G", "B005T3SSLG", "B00BHSTSRA", "B004A7Z3BA", "B0081IOKC2", "B000EOOU6M", "B008IW09VW", "B000P0XYJ4", "B004S4XNEO", "B001588JXQ", "B004VBIEZW", "B008O8K492", "B001JECAM2", "B004UFHXNI", "B004VSTYI6", "B00BF6HYBG", "B004RJ2Y6S", "B00ATHBO86", "B007YK0FLS", "B00B4PJC9K", "B004T0WFVE", "B004CTBYGE", "B00GJXXJBE", "B002CE4I2S", "B00559AJNO", "B007R3YHVG", "B0036MOQCM", "B0013MWTB2", "B0013N0UCQ", "B001AV5ZHG", "B004PDZ6T8", "B00BF6HX8U", "B004UFHXOC", "B000E46SUS", "B004Z0Z4ZW", "B00BF6HXA8", "B004SVIQVM", "B004T166L8", "B002CEMGUO", "B003GSLE4O", "B0002BEQN4", "B00E1BOFUA", "B000P0PF9G", "B0013MT5H8", "B0025ZT1IK", "B0002BEQJ8", "B0013MWT9O", "B002MBZVFE", "B004YUIOXC", "B005C6HZCI", "B001F6W4FW", "B0002KRCH2", "B000LP4RMQ", "B0013N0UEE", "B00BF6HVG4", "B0013MYXDO", "B0028AVGEO", "B0028AYIXK", "B00F0YASQ2", "B00BIFWHN4", "B00BF6HYAW", "B00BNAU772", "B00B8B0Q9A", "B000EZV3T8", "B0038FNIBW", "B00A02DX9S", "B0071GKSL2", "B004LMCZMY", "B00BQU1444", "B006VP97DE", "B0039Z3SRA", "B00CQBY174", "B007W5WU2C", "B00BF6HWCM", "B004T0YAMG", "B0076S5GYE", "B003GSLE3U", "B00BNB62KW", "B0007WW64Y", "B00A02ZU80", "B005KTRQU8", "B004S55MAG"], "bought_together": ["B001EAWS3W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FKP7TY", "B000RN62GQ", "B001EAWS3W", "B0002VM8RU"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories"]]}
