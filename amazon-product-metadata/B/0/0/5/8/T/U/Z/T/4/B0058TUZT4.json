Compared to conventional USB 2.0 with 480MBps, USB 3.0 carries the bandwidth of up to 5Gbps. Based on real-world test results, transfer time of high definition data files such as videos, photos, music, etc is significantly reduced, making instant carrying and sharing rich digital contents quicker and easier. In addition to the USB 3.0 features, Blaze B10 is especially designed for expressive individuals who are playful and bold with their portable storage devices. Smooth curves at two ends of its body get B10 a chic look while its surface is given a special finish for scratchproof and fingerprint-free purpose. Its front is designed with futuristic geometric pattern using heat-sensitive ink; color of the pattern will gradually change from Turkish blue to blazing red according to operating temperature of the drive, adding personality, style and fun to data transferring. Furthermore, Silicon Power includes a heat-sensitive sticker on B10 retail packaging for users to test out the cool color-changing effect of Blaze B10.", "title": "Silicon Power 16 GB Blaze B10 USB 3.0 Flash Drive, Read/Write Speed up to 80/25 MB/s SP016GBUF3B10V1B, Turkey Blue", "price": 11.9, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BQ5P2bmsL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Silicon Power", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040BPHJO", "B00B9BDB14", "B001O1MN72", "B00HZ0M9F2", "B00B7JLZUC", "B00DGZ1NU2", "B004NMF9ES", "B008BZBFTG", "B00I0D81OG", "B00H7PBWK8", "B00H7PBXU2", "B00G9WHMHC", "B00C5K8D5W", "B00HH1MLGQ", "B008BZBGPO", "B00G9WHMCW", "B0057Q4AGW", "B0062XAMI4", "B00C5K8DM0", "B00HFKN1F4", "B00IU34RNU", "B007TTEHUY", "B00EF1G9DW", "B00DL3L2J6", "B00HFKN1YA", "B008RJZQSW", "B0056TYTV6", "B00H7PBWNU", "B00009MDBU", "B00213KDQK", "B00F8WTKHE", "B0009Y7AW8", "B00HFKN1EA", "B00HZ4XKR4", "B00I154CS2", "B00B7JLZUW", "B00I6MJKT6", "B00B7FOQCK", "B0056TYUD8", "B0001ACQQA", "B00EX627A8", "B00004YOHP", "B00DMLPL9Y", "B00HEUIS2G", "B00H707TIW", "B00CP87B20", "B00FDUHD2K", "B00IKT1OGM", "B00I1OM8GG", "B00E3W1726", "B00AP9QMHQ", "B00H7PBXVG", "B0007RXDDM", "B00H7PBXXE", "B00EM71W6I", "B004TS1J18", "B002XVBAKI", "B007JPVVOI", "B00I1PNPD0", "B005FYNSZA", "B000NQ16NG", "B00G429DA6", "B008YTX5EM", "B00G9WHN12", "B007JPVT8G", "B003MTTJOY", "B00DYQYJ3Q", "B008ALA6DW", "B00E83X9P8", "B00DJ3DWFK", "B00A1ZTZNM", "B00EMHM622", "B00HFKN0QO", "B0088PUEPK", "B004TS1J1I", "B00H33SDR4", "B00B7JM0WO", "B007WT9SU0", "B00BQ8RM1A", "B00EUAFAF6", "B00200K1TS", "B004LT6O56", "B005Y8C0H4", "B00081A2KY", "B00EB7UITQ", "B009D79VH4", "B005QWY3PU", "B00E9IFDBU", "B003Y24DEU", "B00BP5KOPA", "B000HLZXH2", "B00K91DB7Y", "B000N99BBC", "B00ELPSEVW"], "bought_together": ["B00B7JLZUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H7PBWK8", "B00H7PBXU2", "B00H7PBWNU", "B0056TYUD8"]}}
