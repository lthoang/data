This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Slim-Grip Ultra Universal Tablet Holder and a Rigid Long Extension Windshield Suction Pedestal with Telescoping Arm. This mount is ideal for cars and especially trucks, vans, or delivery vehicles with deep dashboards. The sturdy telescopic arm of the pedestal extends from 14.5 inches to 18.5 inches, keeping the tablet within easy reach. The suction pedestal installs easily to the windshield. Simply hold the base against the mounting area and push down on the one-touch lever. The top and bottom adjustable-leg design of the Slim-Grip Ultra Holder helps keep any side buttons and ports unobstructed. Included with the spring-loaded holder are 8 support legs (4 short and 4 longer versions) that can be customized depending on the size of the tablet. For most tablets, the best mount holder configuration is to attach 2 short support legs on top and the 2 long support legs on the bottom of the holder."}
