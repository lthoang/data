The 4x manual  zoom lens ring doubles as an on/off power switch, ensuring fast start times to capture even the most  fleeting shooting scenario.Fujifilm X10 HighlightsExceptional Image QualityThe X10 features a newly-developed, larger 2/3-inch 12-megapixel EXR CMOS sensor that combines  Fujifilm's proprietary EXR technology with CMOS technology to provide bright, sharp images in all  shooting conditions. The intelligent EXR CMOS sensor automatically selects the optimum shooting mode  from a total of 99 different variations to capture every type of scene perfectly, even in the most  difficult photography situations.The X10's EXR CMOS sensor selects the optimum shooting mode for any lighting situation:SN (Signal to Noise) High Sensitivity and Low Noise &ndash; produces clear and sharp high-sensitivity  images while keeping noise levels low, which is ideal for capturing night scenes or indoor situations  with poor lighting.DR (Dynamic Range) Wide Dynamic Range &ndash; delivers an increased dynamic range (up to 1600%) to  deliver rich gradations and detail in both shadows and highlights.HR (High Resolution) &ndash; takes full advantage of the 12 megapixel resolution to reproduce the finest  details in landscape and portrait scenes, perfect for use on bright clear days.The X10's fast EXR processor also delivers high-speed continuous shooting &ndash; up to 7 frames per second &ndash; at the full 12-megapixel resolution (L size), and 10 frames per second at  the reduced resolution M size.Bright Optical SystemThe X10 features a newly-developed high-definition FUJINON 4x manual zoom lens (28-112mm) with a Super  EBC (Electron Beam Coating) that achieves superb image clarity from edge to edge. By treating all of  the lens elements with the multilayer Super EBC, the X10 expertly reduces ghosting and lens flare and  delivers an impeccably sharp image.The lens consists of 11 glass lens elements in 9 groups, including 3 aspherical glass lens elements (6  sides) and 2 extra-low dispersion lens elements. Together with its wide-angle maximum aperture of F2.0  to a maximum telephoto aperture of F2.8, the X10 delivers beautiful, bright images with outstanding  clarity.In its spacious glass optical viewfinder, the X10 uses an arrangement of 3 aspherical lenses plus a  special 2 glass prism configuration to give the photographer a composition experience that is marked by  superior brightness and superb field of view with its extra wide 20&deg; viewing angle.X10 Premium Shooting ExperienceIn less than one second, photographers can be ready to shoot in almost any situation thanks to the  X10's power switch that has been aptly integrated into the manual zoom barrel. This smart and simple  design feature allows faster photography response times and helps to avoid missed photo opportunities.Once ready to shoot, the X10's all-metal lens barrel and smooth zoom rotation helps you compose photos  quickly and easily, and its remarkably quick shutter-release lag time of approximately 0.01 seconds  lets you capture even the most momentary of photography scenarios.The X10 also features a newly developed Optical Image Stabilization mechanism that all but eliminates  motion blur by maximizing sensor performance, and its 49-point matrix contrast auto focus provides  high-speed and high-precision focusing thanks to the fast CMOS capabilities and the advanced EXR  Processor system.The X10's lens is capable of taking super-macro shots as close up as 1cm, and combined with its 7-blade  aperture, the X10 generates a stunning soft-focus &ldquo;bokeh&rdquo; effect that makes it the ideal choice for  shooting perfect portraits.The X10 is proudly manufactured in Japan, and as a mark of true quality, it prominently features the  words &ldquo;made in Japan&rdquo; along the rear of the chassis near the viewfinder.X10 Key Features4x manual optical zoom featuring Fujifilm's new Intelligent Digital Zoom technology that doubles  telephoto capabilities and provides up to 8x zoomFast power start-up; the X10 is fully ready to shoot in approximately 0.8 seconds using the on/off  power switch built into the lens ring (must be in Quick Start mode)High-contrast and wide viewing-angle 2.8\" 460K dot high contrast LCD screen that provides excellent  viewing even outdoors and in bright sunlightDiverse manual shooting modes that can be selected according to scene type (Program / Aperture  Priority / Shutter Speed Priority / Manual)Four diverse auto bracketing functions for exposure, ISO sensitivity, dynamic range and film  simulationRAW shooting and in-camera RAW processing (SilkyPix RAW conversion software supplied in-box)Best-in-class3 1080p Full HD movie recording capabilitiesFilm Simulation Modes (eight setting are available, including Velvia / PROVIA / ASTIA)Manual pop-up flash with a range of 7 meters (approximately 23 feet)Electronic horizon leveling gauge to ensure that the camera is being held level, and histogram  display to check image gradationMotion Panorama 360&deg; for seamless 360-degree panoramic shooting"}
