Cooler Master believes that just because something is affordable, it doesn't have to lack features or be a \"budget\" product. The Elite 431 Plus features a classic black Cooler Master design with clean, yet attractive lines. It has been built to last and uses high quality materials, unlike many \"budget\" products that tend to use cheaper materials that don't last. It's also been designed to keep the components inside the case cool and not only does it have space for plenty of additional cooling fans, but it can also be fitted with large CPU coolers, such as the CoolerMaster Hyper 212 Plus."}
