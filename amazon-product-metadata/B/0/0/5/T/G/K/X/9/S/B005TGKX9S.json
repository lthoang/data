The new high-quality LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens system is even more versatile with 24mm ultra wide-angle* to powerful 16x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 24-384mm). Comprising 12 elements in 10 groups, including an ED lens and 3 aspherical lenses with 6 aspherical surfaces, this advanced lens unit suppresses chromatic aberration which tends to occur in telephoto shooting. It also boasts a short total length of lens unit despite its higher versatility with longer zoom range, which is made possible by development of a new mechanism for the structure of lens barrel. The lens system is also compatible with high shutter speed of min.1/4,000 sec.*Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position."}
