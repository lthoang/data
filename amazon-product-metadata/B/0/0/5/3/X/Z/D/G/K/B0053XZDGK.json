Sometimes truth can be every bit as strange as fiction and fiction can sound like the truth. The challenge of Urban Myth is to differentiate between fact and modern folklore, between what you thought you knew and what you have heard as gospel truth from a trusted friend. This is a completely unique game that will test your pop culture savvy and provide excitement and surprises for groups of two or more players."}
