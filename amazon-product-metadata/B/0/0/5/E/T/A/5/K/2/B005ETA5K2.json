The AWUS036NHR utilizes a new 802.11n chipset from Realtek (RTL8188RU) and is light years ahead of its predecessor. Alfa's AWUS036NHR combines the fast speed of 802.11n with long range reception for both 802.11g and 802.11n standards.This Device is the best Alfa has Produced yet.If you're built-in Wi-Fi adapter is not picking up your Router or if you are trying to pick up Wi-Fi from long distances then this is the device to get! The AWUS036NH Receiver sensitivity will allow you to connect from greater distances and get stronger signals to Wi-Fi networks around you. With maximum speeds of 150 mbps to 802.11n routers, AWUS036NHR is also a perfect solution for video streaming, large downloads, and online gaming. Windows 7 users can easily turn AWUS036NHR into a simultaneous access point using Connectify, a free programMost Network Adaptors can get great Range and sensitivity when the router that they are receiving form is set to \"N-only\" mode which blocks backward compatibility with B and G adaptors but most people are not able to set the router to N-only mode as this would block connectivity for G-only devices like iPhones, Android phones, and many DVRs. This  AWUS036NHR is one of the first Wi-Fi adapters to get very good receive sensitivity to both 802.11n-only, 802.11n/g mixed, and 802.11g networksFeatures- Compatible with IEEE 802.11n, 802.11b/g/n wireless standards- 2.4GHz frequency band, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)- Complies with Universal Serial Bus Rev. 2.0 specifications- High speed transfer TX data rate up to 150 Mbps- Supports wireless data encryption with 64/128-bit WEP, WPA, WPA2, TKIP, AES4n- Support software AP- Compliant with FCC Part 15.247 for US, ETS 300 328 for Europe- Supports driver for Windows 2000, XP 32/64, Vista 32/64, Windows 7 - Mac (10.4.x/10.5.x/10.6.x) Power PC& PC.", "title": "Alfa AWUS036NHR - High-Gain 2000mw 2W 802.11 B/G/N Wireless USB Network Adaptor - Wireless-N 802.11n Wi-Fi - 150Mbps - 2.4 GHz - 5dBi Antenna - Long Range - Realtek Chipset - Strongest on the Market - NEWEST VERSION", "price": 33.09, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WG-4B1uVL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Alfa", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VX0RXY", "B004ZF0I3U", "B000SEQGT2", "B0039ORBLK", "B0054MLMLA", "B002MUU6L4", "B003M6FDS8", "B000WXSO76", "B000FICJ8S", "B003ILWRLI", "B003YHYIT0", "B003CFATOW", "B005C8AYG0", "B003ZWPRUI", "B003U6825G", "B007FUU9H2", "B000EREM6C", "B004Y6MIXS", "B00428R89M", "B000NZNTVE", "B0035APGP6", "B002VG39BI", "B004MTBGCG", "B002BFO490", "1494295504", "B003ZWPS3O", "B004K2I70E", "B008VP5H2M", "B003YIFHJY", "B005F0BP1I", "B005HIJCB8", "B00478O6AG", "B0038Q4AIG", "B007M7RP6Q", "B006Z8MJ6Y", "B005GQ8JR4", "B004I5J2XY", "0124077498", "B003YD9PRE", "B0044D7J1W", "B000ERAOMS", "B00DSVPAGM", "1849515581", "B0035GWTKK", "B002SZEOLG", "B0040R7QL0", "B00K7EEX2U", "B001GUSCH6", "B001GUOAW2", "B00J2LIHEO", "B008X0F5PY", "B00H6ZE3N2", "B000VIA4CA", "B003MTTJOY", "B002FRFB5U", "B005G20NRC", "B00CHHMFC0", "1494932636", "B00CF8R0WG", "B000PKX2KA", "B005DCP280", "B001GUSCFS", "B00DJUU0KS", "B004YD7UBQ", "B001GUW2WC", "B009SQQF9C", "B00IO0T1GM", "B002IUH6QQ", "B0085WCB9I", "159327288X", "B004S3OKLK", "0124116442", "B001BSK3NO", "B003E3HJXQ", "0789751275", "B004WW5WAA", "B00CJ3DCE2", "B006JWMOOI", "1118825098", "B00GNTIDH4", "1783289597", "B0085X3PRE", "B00HJ1NQLS", "B00IKMJ9B6", "B00CJSOYMG", "B001TH7GUU", "B00E8C1S8E", "B00CHYOLHK", "B004X1IQ4O", "1597499579", "B004WPUHXO", "1449902529", "B00C2C8NCQ", "B00BP9QSK6", "B003LLS5JI"], "bought_together": ["B000SEQGT2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YIFHJY", "B003YHYIT0", "B000WXSO76", "B0038Q4AIG"]}}
