They, just like you, had grown tired of repeatedly using and re-using harsh, chemical sprays or frequently changing bulky and expensive filters in competing air purifiers that, at best, were not very effective at removing odors and restoring freshness to the indoor environment.  But with the GT50, these customers were able to restore air quality to their environment by simply plugging this small, simple device into any outlet and then just setting the adjustable knob to their preferred level of air purification.The GT50 uses the scientifically-acclaimed power of activated oxygen (ozone), in conjunction with negative ionization, to destroy E-coli, MRSA, Legionella, Candida, Staph, Salmonella and Giardia more effectively than filters or chemical disinfectants.  With the GT50, the effectiveness goes way beyond what you see and smell.  In fact, it kills E-coli more than 3,000 times faster than chlorine.  It is Ideal for bathrooms, laundry rooms, work stations, janitorial closets or kitchens.  It even kills mold and mildew in bathrooms.So lightweight and compact that it fits easily into the palm of your hand, the GT50 consumes less than 7 watts of power, less than a night light bulb. The GT50 comes with a comprehensive owner's manual.  Its designer-inspired packaging makes it a gift of infinite value anyone would be proud to give or receive...  Experience the renewed energy and life-enhancing effects of breathing pure, clean air, and stop the proliferation of toxic bacteria that are polluting your indoor environment and compromising your health without your even realizing it."}
