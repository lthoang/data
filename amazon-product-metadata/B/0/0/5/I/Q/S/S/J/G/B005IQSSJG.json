It is light weight and easy to fold.  Please allow for 5-8% manufacturing shrinkage.To attach this beautiful background to your support system, simply slide your crossbar into the rod pocket.  You can then let the back ground hang to provide a beautiful scene for your photos and videos.  To help remove wrinkles you can iron on a low setting with a buffer suck as a towel between the muslin and the iron.  It is also recommend steaming the background just before a shoot to help minimize any wrinkles that were acquired during transit.Please keep in mind that no two backgrounds will be exact.  Due to being made by hand colors can vary slightly as well as the location and application of the dye."}
