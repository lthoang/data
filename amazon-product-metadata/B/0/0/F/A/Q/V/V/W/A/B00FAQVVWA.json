The Joker has a menacing, mega-sized frozen smile, and his cruel plans are even more treacherous in this gargantuan style. The DC Super Heroes must dodge his barrel-shaped fists that capture everything in their path with mutant strength. Boys can engage his fists of fury by squeezing his legs and then help our DC Super Heroes outfight and outsmart him. Will they be captured and used for The Joker's evil deeds or succeed and make him a laughing stock? With the included Batman, Superman and The Joker Robo Rampage Figures, a fierce battle is ready to be waged right out of the box! Includes one Batman figure, one Superman figure and one The Joker figure. Ages 4 and older."}
