You can and even put yourself in the picture without having to make that silly 10 second dash. Wireless control allows users to step away from the camera when shooting. It is for use with the following Nikon cameras: D40, D40X, D50, D60, D70, D70S, D80, D90, D610, D600, D3300, D3000, D3200,D5000, D5100, D5200, D5300, D7000, D7100, CoolPix P7800, Coolpix P6000, P7000, P7100, N65, N75, Coolpix 8400, 8800, Pronea S, Nuvis S & Lite Touch Zoom Cameras, Nikon 1 J1, Nikon 1 J2 and Nikon 1 V1. It acts as a wireless shutter release capable of instantly triggering the shutter without disturbing the camera, up to a distance of approximately 16' (4.87 m) in front of the camera. It is recommended for taking pictures of subjects that are difficult to approach, or to minimize vibration for close-ups and time exposure, and it is powered by a CR-2025 3v battery (included). The ML-L3 supports the bulb exposure camera setting making it a worthwhile accessory for shooting long time exposures for low-light photography or unusual daylight effects. It doesn't work for D3100 because D3100 does not have an IR transmitter built into the unitSpecifications:Total length: 2.5 inchProduct Weight: 0.04 ozWhat's included:1xFotoTech Wireless Remote, 1x FotoTech Velvet Bag: 9.5cm x 6cm* Nikon are registered trademarks of Nikon Corporation.
