The main benefit of nanoe technology is that it has the capability of adding moisture back to your hair. How? The flat iron features a circulating system which absorbs moisture from the hair into the nanoe mechanism; then, converts the evaporated moisture into nanoe ions which are emitted through the outer vents and added back to the hair.  The nanoe flat also includes a heat recovery system allows the flat iron to maintain a stable temperature.  This improves styling performance by 35%* The Nanoe flat-iron has ceramic-coated plates that glide smoothly over your hair and five variable heat settings provide the perfect temperature range for every hair type, length and style: 300&#xB0; F, 340&#xB0; F, 355&#xB0; F, 375&#xB0; F, 395&#xB0; F.  For safety, the Automatic Shut-off function turns off the unit after 60 minutes.  The flat iron is complete with a 9-foot cord which swivels for ease of use at any angle. The open-close lock is great for storage. 2-year limited warranty.
