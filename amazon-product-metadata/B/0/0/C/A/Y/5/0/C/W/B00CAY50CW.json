{"asin": "B00CAY50CW", "description": "A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers have had enough of US military occupation all over the world and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on U.S. interests. When our nation is threatened, the president turns to one man and one man only: Sam Fisher. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad replicates Sam&#x2019;s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones and the sticky cam through touch and motion based inputs. The Wii U GamePad allows for faster reaction times, letting the player mark enemies, switch weapons, quick reload and choose gadgets to adapt to any situation, among other features.", "price": 29.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fjlBIvBRL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BORFD9Q", "B002I0H0NU", "B00C7107DU", "B0050SVH18", "B002I0H0FS", "B00897Z218", "B00BMFIXEW", "B00897Z27C", "B00B59L9YG", "B002I0GCD4", "B00E8A06DO", "B0088I7KT0", "B008AU4YEA", "B00A8305EA", "B00A39IEN8", "B002I08CSW", "B002I0GD06", "B008MO6B1S", "B002I0K2YO", "B00DC7G2W8", "B009CLBY0I", "B009EWHKAI", "B008UQGHTE", "B009AFLXTS", "B002I0K3CK", "B00DC7G0GG", "B008L1PYGK", "B00A878J5I", "B00CSLIYXY", "B00KWF803C", "B002I0GCQ6", "B00KWEHBAG", "B002I0H0K8", "B00F9N08WI", "B00897Z240", "B00CW3E9EQ", "B009NRO1J2", "B009AFLXQQ", "B00DC7G1WE", "B002I0GF72", "B00KWFCU4M", "B00DC7O77A", "B009LWQ3O0", "B00KWFCUNS", "B00AZ70ZA8", "B002I0K3M0", "B00BRQJYA8", "B00KWF366S", "B0050SWP96", "B00ANHBJBY", "B008UR2JEA", "B00CQ7CIMS", "B00KWF38AW", "B00DD0B0BM", "B00KWIYS3K", "B0086V5TYC", "B00A878J4E", "B00G0OYHCW", "B00L3LQ4B4", "B00KY59REG", "B002EE7OKE", "B00L3LQ1FI", "B00KWIYPZG", "B00KVRK39A", "B00GGGOO9A", "B00FRESQKU", "B00KX7672U", "B00K2O4O6U", "B00K278IWS", "B00KWFCV32", "B00B98HG18", "B00CBVHI56", "B002I0K3PM", "B00KVSQ848", "B0088I86SO", "B00JK00S0S", "B00D8IAND0", "B0085KW38O", "B00KWFY04A", "B004L491A6", "B007CSF3GO", "B00DC7FWRE", "B009O3WU2A", "B00CHYOP94", "B0094X1ZXU", "B008BT2FFA", "B001TOMR0C", "B009D4JW3U", "B006476318", "B00K278H60", "B00FLYZ7NU", "B00C3MK9BS", "B009AFLXJS", "B00D41GCVS", "B00GLZQR96", "B00KVOVBGM", "B000Z9A95M", "B0019SY1D4", "B00JKM09Z0"], "bought_together": ["B00BORFD9Q", "B00897Z27C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BORFD9Q", "B00DC7G2W8", "B00897Z27C", "B00E8A06DO"]}, "salesRank": {"Video Games": 781}, "categories": [["Video Games", "Wii U", "Games"]]}
