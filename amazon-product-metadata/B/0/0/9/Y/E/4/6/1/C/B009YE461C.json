It&#x2019;s the only Dolica tripod that utilizes ultra-precise CNC machining to create 95% of the parts of the tripod. What CNC (computer numerical controlled) mean for you is all the parts are created from a single block of aluminum from a CNC machine. This is advantageous from the traditional cast aluminum tripod because CNC parts have the tightest tolerances so the tripod is perfect specifications to the original that makes for very smooth operating tripod. Also since the LX600B502D/S tripod is made from single block of aluminum you have a much stronger tripod part for part since a single block of CNC aluminum is significantly stronger than cast aluminum it will last much longer to wear and tear. Also CNC tripods are capable of a protective anodized finish that also makes the tripod resistant rubbing, chipping, and peeling and allow for protective finish that will be beautiful for many years.", "title": "Dolica LX600B502DS  Ultra Premium Professional 60-Inch Lightweight Aluminum Alloy Tripod (Black)", "price": 164.0, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31NfdnRVD5L._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Dolica", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004AH10K8", "B0049H89F8", "B009EM694G", "B0081ER9KG", "B000PTFDYO", "B0093HGEKG", "B00AEEDRFM", "B0049XGNKK", "B00E83XHXM", "B002KDS2BY", "B009YE462G", "B0045KGZOG", "B0095ZKUD8", "B001KELVS0", "B007FH1KX2", "B004MFQ2I8"], "bought_together": ["B004AH10K8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009YE462G", "B004XC3GWU", "B007HO50NO", "B001D60LG8"]}}
