{"asin": "B009N8M2P6", "description": "The Lite Way to Support Your iPad. Pad Pillow Lite takes most everything that has made the original Pad Pillow a big success and makes it even smaller, lighter, and more travel-ready. Perfect as a take-along for iPad mini as well as eBook readers like Nook, Pad Pillow Lite is all about comfort and versatility for reading, surfing, watching videos and more. At only 5.9 ounces and measuring less than 10 inches wide and long (and even shorter when it's folded up), Pad Pillow Lite is a great alternative to bulkier stands. And because it's made from a high-density foam, it's more comfortable to place on your lap or stomach when you're sitting or lying down. It will also support your device on a wide variety of surfaces, like carpet and upholstery, which you can't say for most stands made with plastic or steel. Two distinct viewing angles are possible depending on Pad Pillow Lite's position. Lay it flat out for a slight incline, or fold it up and secure with embedded magnets for a steeper angle. A sewn tag provides a simple bumper to keep your device in place. Available in Dark Gray and Pink, Pad Pillow Lite is guaranteed to be your favorite comfy companion for iPad, tablet computers and eReaders.", "title": "Ipevo PadPillow Lite Pillow Stand for iPad mini and 7-Inch Tablets - Dark Gray (MEPX-06IP)", "price": 16.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415M2ZxsV5L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005HM2L4O", "B007W0HLKS", "B005HM0SNA", "B005MKH1XC", "B005HM49IU", "B004TLH7C0", "B00E77V7NG", "B007NFBJAK", "B00CGUCBVI", "B0068WOKCS", "B00ANAHMVC", "B000CKVOOY", "B004W697ES", "B006ZT4VA0", "B00CKG61WI", "B0095PEF70", "B006JD3F0Y", "B007FXMOV8"], "bought_together": ["B005HM2L4O", "B004TLH7C0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005HM2L4O", "B005HM49IU", "B005HM0SNA", "B00E77V7NG"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Touch Screen Tablet Accessories", "Stands"]]}
