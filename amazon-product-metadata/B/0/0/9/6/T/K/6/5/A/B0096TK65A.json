{"asin": "B0096TK65A", "description": "This is a great item to have for any Nexus Tablet owner. The case has a removable semi rigid keyboard. The keyboard can easily be connected to an Nexus Tablet by Bluetooth. The case also has a sturdy stand on the back to help the Nexus Tablet from falling back when pressing on the screen. Many similar items do not have a sturdy support for the Nexus Tablet which results in the Nexus Tablet easily falling down if pressing on the screen. The clasp to keep the case closed does not use a magnet, so it will not interfere with your Nexus Tablet. The Snap On case has the benefit of not interfering with the Nexus Tablet's automatic light sensor. We also include a screen protector so that your Nexus Tablet will be completely protected", "title": "Ionic Tablet stand Leather for (2012) Amazon kindle Fire HD 7 keyboard case bluetooth (Black/Brown)", "price": 24.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eTVHqYvaL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000652SOK", "B00AFKC6KC", "B008THTOKS", "B00C5W16B8", "B00951UZPA", "B00A2VHALY", "B00E8ZDCDU", "B00A439ISI", "B00FIYHLSW", "B006GWO5WK", "B009QX8KW2", "B00FGOLFZO", "B008SYWFNA", "B00951ULKO", "B00FJ8JGIA", "B00AV1UYQS", "B00BWYQ9YE", "B00AAKLFHM", "B009G4M20M", "B00CY4PANM", "B006GWO5NE", "B005QX7KYU", "B009PH58YW", "B004C3AW40", "B00DQGIHNW", "B004GCJEZU", "B005GI2VMG", "B00FGI3CBU", "B00A3NI8K8"], "bought_together": ["B008SYWFNA", "B006GWO5WK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C5W16B8", "B00BWYQ9YE", "B00BX6JF24", "B00A2VHALY"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Touch Screen Tablet Accessories", "Cases & Sleeves", "Cases"]]}
