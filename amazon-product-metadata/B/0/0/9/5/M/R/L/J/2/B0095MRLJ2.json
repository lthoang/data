{"asin": "B0095MRLJ2", "description": "The SAPPHIRE HD 7750 1GB Low profile model is based on the highly acclaimed Graphics Core Next architecture from AMD, and retains all the features of the HD 7700 series but in a truly low profile format. Many low profile cards use a cooler that is actually larger than the PCB format, and cannot be used in slimline cases. The SAPPHIRE solution uses a specially developed single slot cooler with an efficient ball bearing fan and heatsink design that truly follows the low profile format. This makes it ideally suited to applications like HTPCs or installation in even the slimmest styles of mini-ITX cases. Performance is the same as other implementations of the HD 7750, with core clock speed of 800MHz and 1GB of GDDR5 memory clocked at 4500MHz (effective). Output configuration is very flexible, including multi-monitor support for AMD Eyefinity. Its Dual-Link DVI-I, HDMI and Displayport outputs are all mounted within the low-profile backplate. This has been achieved by the use of mini-DP and micro HDMI sockets. A set of Mini-DP to DP, micro-HDMI to HDMI, and DVI-I to VGA adapters are all supplied with the card, as well as both low profile and standard height backplates.", "title": "Sapphire 100357LP Radeon HD 7750 1GB 128-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Video Card", "price": 43.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mWLpkV5vL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008551ZI8", "B0093H8K1C", "B0035FIS2O", "B004GGUAUE", "B0065SM75M", "B005ITOAL8", "B002O1W6ZK", "B0080ATR2Y", "B005LLBBSS", "B00DL4BMRC", "B009VCAJ7W", "B00DU6RVK8", "B003N8GVUY", "B007WLR89G", "B00A8ZZXFE", "B008VQ2Y4K", "B008UHO2VI", "B009NB8WRU", "B0037TO5C0", "B00906G97I", "B002BH3Z8E", "B008F65MO0", "B0088PUEPK", "B009NHAF06", "B002M1DHJG", "B005DKZTMG", "B007RQ0HKS", "B007RQ0HSA", "B004Q0PT3I", "B0025VKUN4", "B00FLMKR32", "B000OGX5AM", "B009NQMESS", "B003H4QPDC", "B00BQXLMX4", "B0035FIS2Y", "B002N2EHVQ", "B005TWE6B8", "B007Z3T5JC", "B0011A4UZE", "B00ALYORA4", "B004QRKWKQ", "B00A1ZTZOG", "B006GD30UC", "B007RIFLVQ", "B003MTTJOY", "B0077POH8M", "B00E3W15P0", "B008JJLW4M", "B007ZWLRSU", "B007SZ0E1K", "B008BZBFTG", "B00552PMWE", "B005S0X1HG", "B001R4BT1M", "B004DDI0IE", "B00H09BOXQ", "B009NHAEXE", "B006V5SZMI", "B009AT5SVS", "B000233ZDY", "B002YIG9AQ", "B008J0ZOV8", "B005C31GIA", "B000KZW9WM", "B004CRSM4I", "B00E3W1726", "B0058UVVX2", "B00H7Y3I4M", "B004VF4R4U", "B0057Q4AGW", "B006JH8T3S", "B003FE7GTG", "B004HKIB6E", "B001O4EPHA", "B006EWUO22", "B009VY1R9O", "B00DGZ1NU2", "B005T3GRLY", "B007SZ0EHE", "B0092ML1SC", "B006XB56VI", "B00D12OAVE", "B0060RUVBA", "B005BZNDS0", "B000O7WFHA", "B0060AU5MW", "B00B99JU5M", "B001TH7T2U", "B00CO8TBQ0", "B000292DO0", "B009F1DYF8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004X8EO6Q", "B007Z3T5JC", "B008RLHFQ6", "B00BQXLMX4"]}, "categories": [["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Graphics Cards"]]}
