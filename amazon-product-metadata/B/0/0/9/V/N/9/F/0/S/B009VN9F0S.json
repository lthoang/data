Whether for work or play, we spend a significant amount of time interacting with our gadgets. Its inevitable that our daily use will leave its mark in the form of scratches, abrasions, and just plain old wear and tear. And while there are cases and covers designed to protect our devices, more often than not, the added bulk and weight of a protector only seem to make them clumsier to handle.Total ProtectionWith this problem in mind, Skinomi has created the TechSkin Full Body line. Made from the same thermoplastic polyurethane as used by the military, the film is durable, tough and provides protection comparable to cases and covers by shielding your whole device. It acts as a self-healing skin against scratches, abrasions, and more.
