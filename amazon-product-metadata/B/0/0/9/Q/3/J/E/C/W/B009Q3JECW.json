What Are Jigsaw Whimsy Pieces? \"Whimsies\" add a whole new level to this popular indoor pastime and can make a puzzle a lot more fun. Whimsies are puzzle pieces cut into specific recognizable shapes, like flowers or animals. They got their name because they were originally cut according to the whims of the puzzle craftsman. Stephen Lyman was an explorer who specialized in painting the most elusive moments in nature. Stephen Lyman's work was inspired by the writing and teaching of famous naturalist John Muir. Stephen Lyman's love of the outdoors stemmed from a childhood spent in the Pacific Northwest, where hiking in Snake River country was a regular family ritual. Stephen Lyman recently named one of the top artists in the country."}
