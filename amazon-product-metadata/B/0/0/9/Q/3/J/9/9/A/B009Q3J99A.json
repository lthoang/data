What Are Jigsaw Whimsy Pieces? \"Whimsies\" add a whole new level to this popular indoor pastime and can make a puzzle a lot more fun. Whimsies are puzzle pieces cut into specific recognizable shapes, like flowers or animals. They got their name because they were originally cut according to the whims of the puzzle craftsman. Lane started painting at age 12. Lane went to Northern Illinois for her undergraduate work, and continued the studies at Southeastern Oklahoma University where a Master's Degree was obtained. Lane was one of 45 artist chosen worldwide to study under Robert Bateman in his Master's Class. Lane arranges her work on feelings and combines Nature with Native American spiritual beliefs. No two puzzle pieces are the same and include interlocking border pieces. The pieces feature a clean snap and fit, found only among the highest quality jigsaw puzzles."}
